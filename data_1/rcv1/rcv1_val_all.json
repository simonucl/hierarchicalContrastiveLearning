{"token": "Police using batons and teargas stormed a Paris church on Friday and evicted 300 African migrants, including 10 on a 50-day-old hunger strike in protest against moves to expel them from France.The Saint-Bernard church bells sounded the alarm as hundreds of helmeted police moved in, struggling with sympathisers including media celebrities who had surrounded it for several days to back the Africans' demand for residence papers.Police broke down the church's main gate and burst through a barricade of chairs to remove the hunger strikers on stretchers.The raid, greeted with an outcry on the Left and plaudits on the Right, came after Prime Minister Alain Juppe refused to grant the protesters blanket permission to stay in the country but promised to review their cases individually.The protesters' spokeswoman Madjiguene Cisse said they were being taken to military hospitals in the Saint Mande and Clamart suburbs. Police said the other protesters were taken to a detention centre in the suburb of Vincennes.Activists lay on the street in the path of police vans, vainly trying to stop them driving the protesters away.The CFDT trade union at national airline Air France called on airport personnel to oppose police should they try to fly the immigrants home. Most are from Mali.Chanting \"French people, immigrants, solidarity\", activists kept confronting police for hours after the church was evacuated and called a protest march at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT). Police cordoned off the area in the heavily immigrant Goutte d'Or district, Juppe's former constituency.Radio reports said some people had blood on their faces, but police said no-one had been injured.Police said 40 people were being held and six would be prosecuted for assaulting police. Witnesses said film beauty Emanuelle Beart was taken to a police van but officials said she had requested to follow the protesters and was not detained.She was among several celebrities who had vowed to chain themselves to the Africans to prevent police from removing them.But she was outside the church having coffee when police moved in at 7.45 a.m. (0545 GMT), wrong-footing the protesters who had expected a police raid at 6 a.m. the earliest time police can enter a building under French law.\"It is scandalous to break down a church gate and use violence against distressed people,\" said self-appointed mediator Stephane Hessel, a former French United Nations envoy.Opposition Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande voiced shock. \"We were close to a negotiated settlement that would have ended a fast endangering lives,\" he said.The fasters, who like the other protesters have been in the church since June, have been drinking sweet tea and taking vitamin pills, but two are said to be in a serious condition.\"They are not being taken to concentration camp, but to hospitals where they will surely feel better than at the church,\" said Michel Pericard, floor leader of the ruling RPR Gaullist party at the National Assembly.\"The law is not to be negotiated but enforced,\" he said.The police raid came after Juppe announced on television on Thursday that France's highest administrative court, the Council of State, had endorsed his view that the 300 Africans were not legally entitled, as a group, to residence permits.But he said the government still intended to review their right to remain in France on a case-by-case basis and had no intention of using deportation to break up families or expel seriously ill individuals.Many of the protesters say they once had residence rights and were plunged into illegality by hardline 1993 immigration laws pushed through by then interior minister Charles Pasqua at a time of mounting anti-immigrant sentiment.Lawyers say loopholes in the laws, which also tightened conditions for citizenship, have created a legal nightmare.\"If there are holes in the law, they must be filled up but the whole law cannot be called into question. Deputies who voted it knew what they were doing,\" Pericard said.", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Others saw the reforms as a \"supposed surrender to capitalism and its economic formulas,\" it said, adding, \"This view is not only mistaken but unfair.\"Cuba's leaders have made clear that only \"elements of capitalism\" are being introduced, such as management, financing and market techniques, the document said.", "label": ["E11", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing on Monday warned that entry criteria for Europe's planned currency union must not be altered, speaking out in a smoldering debate on the issue among European leaders.\"As we have said on many occasions, a softening of the convergence criteria is out of the question in our opinion,\" Issing told a group of bankers.  In recent days Italian officials have stirred a long simmering debate on European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) criteria by suggesting they should be renegotiated in light of Europe's sluggish economic growth and fiscal problems.Nations wishing to join the union at its planned starting date on January 1, 1999 must show their budget deficits are not exceeding three percent of gross domestic product while their total public debt does not exceed 60 percent of gross domestic product.  But Issing rejected the calls for more lenient entry criteria suggesting instead that nations must go one step further and adopt another document to ensure lasting stability once the union is founded.Issing said it was also important to adopt a stability pact, currently being discussed by European leaders, which would impose automatic sanctions on members straying from the original targets.  But commenting on speculation that countries may be let into EMU even if they exceed the prescribed targets, Issing said the stability pact could not be seen as a replacement for the original entry criteria.\"We cannot get around implementing a stability pact but not as a replacement for the convergence criteria. The stability criteria must be observed,\" Issing said.A stability pact's sanctions were particularly important because the Maastricht Treaty, setting out the rules for the currency union, held no provisions to expel a nation for bad behaviour, Issing said.\"Expulsion is not a planned option,\" Issing said, adding, \"The economic cost of quitting EMU, disregarding the political ramifications, would be immense.\"He warned that Germany was currently in danger of missing both the debt and deficit criteria this year.\"There is a danger that Germany will again clearly miss the three percent deficit criteria this year and recently it has also exceeded the 60 percent debt target,\" Issing said.--Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525", "label": ["E12", "E21", "ECAT", "G151", "G15", "G154", "GCAT", "M13", "M132", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

It is fighting Khartoum's government forces in the south for greater autonomy or independence from the Moslem north.Sisters Moira Lynch, 73, Mary Batchelor, 68, and Maureen Carey, 52, are held at a missionary compound in Mapourdit with American Father Michael Barton, 48, Sudanese Father Raphael Riel, 48, and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella, 28, church and Australian foreign ministry sources said.The nuns may have resisted efforts by the rebels this month to recruit some of the school's 1,500 students to their cause, Mazzolari said.\"They may have resisted the recruiting because they had been assured they (the rebels) would not come to the school,\" he said.Earlier, the foreign ministry in Canberra said the accusations against the missionaries were bizarre. \"These reports (of the spying charges) are a matter of great concern,\" a ministry official told Reuters.Australian diplomats in Nairobi, capital of Kenya neighbouring Sudan, are working with the Catholic church in southern Sudan and with U.S. and Italian diplomats to free the missionaries, the official added.The three nuns are members of the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart order. They and the other missionaries had been held by the rebels since August 17, Mazzolari said.Nuns from the order in Sydney were distressed by the reports of the spying charges on Tuesday and were \"just trying to get some space to say some prayers\", a Catholic church spokeswoman in Sydney said.A senior member of the Sydney order of nuns will fly to the Kenyan capital, arriving there on Friday, \"to see if she can help at all\", the spokeswoman said.News of the spying charges emerged after a weekend attempt to secure the release of the missionaries failed, the Australian foreign ministry official said.A plane was to have met the missionaries and their captors near Mapourdit at the weekend under an arrangement agreed between the rebels and Sudanese priests, the official said.\"But they were not waiting for them as arranged,\" he said.The official expressed concern for their health. \"They are quite elderly...

{"token": "Transrapid, Germany's futuristic, high-speed magnetic railway project, should generate an annual income of one billion marks ($670 million), chief executive Dieter Baum said in a newspaper story published on Sunday.He told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that contracts were almost complete to build and service the magnetic levitation trains that will cover the 290-km (180 mile) Hamburg-Berlin route in about an hour when they start running in 2005.Bonn hopes the Transrapid will become a standard-bearer for the world's next generation of high-speed trains, giving Germany a lead over Japan in rail technology's challenge to regional airline traffic in the next century.Baum, the designated head of its future operating firm, told the newspaper that the Transrapid operator, Magnetschnellbahn Berlin-Hamburg Betriebsgesellschaft mbH, would be founded officially in Berlin this year or early in 1997.It would go public by autumn 1998 with starting equity capital of 500 million marks.Using so-called magnetic-levitation propulsion technology developed by Thyssen, the Transrapid will hover above a slim rail.The project, with trains racing between Germany's two largest cities at top speeds of 400 km (248 miles) an hour, will be the first of its kind in commercial operation if it starts on schedule.Baum said building work would begin next year with the main contracts to build and service the track and trains to be spread among members of a consortium financing half of the semi-state project.\"Of course we are seeking tenders Europe-wide. But it is not conceivable that any other firm could provide the standards needed,\" he told the newspaper.Transrapid is 50 percent-financed by a consortium comprising Thyssen, Siemens, Daimler-Benz, Hochtief, Holzmann, Bilfinger & Berger AG and Deutsche Bahn AG, the German railway operator.Baum added that it would be simplest to give Deutsche Bahn the role of monitoring the track, trains and personnel.Annual operating costs for the venture would be around 280 million marks a year, Baum said. In addition, Deutsche Bahn would receive around 130 million marks a year for use of the tracks and another 170 million marks once the venture is in profit. He declined to forecast profit figures.Estimated to cost at least nine billion marks, Transrapid is going ahead amid harsh criticism from environmentalists who say Germany's existing ICE high-speed trains use a third of the energy the magnetic levitation trains will need.Embarrassed by the failure of the ICE high-speed rail to compete internationally against the TGV of France, Bonn hopes Transrapid will boost Germany in the global battle for innovative technology,Baum, a 56-year-old engineer, said he was preparing for his role at the helm of the Transrapid project by discussing similar ventures in other countries, primarily the Eurotunnel project, the undersea rail link between Britain and France.\"I recently spoke with the Eurotunnel head Alistair Morton in London and went through some of his company's teething problems,\" Baum said, commenting that Eurotunnel was a riskier venture because the state had no involvement.Baum said the existence of an operating firm for Transrapid would make it easier to monitor building schedules and pricing and said the German project would not be hit by price-slashing by competitors, as Eurotunnel was.In addition, while Eurotunnel was confronted continually with fresh security demands as building went on, Baum said he planned to finalise security issues by the end of next year.The main risks for Transrapid were a lower-than-expected demand for the service or a delay in construction.\"The worst would be delays. One year would mean a loss of 700 million marks,\" Baum said.Transrapid is targeting annual passenger numbers of 14.5 million. However Baum said the venture could still turn a profit by 2010 if numbers were as low as 12.5 million. ($1=1.4895 Mark)", "label": ["C15", "C152", "C24", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Syria's readiness to resume the peace talks comes within this context,\" Moussa said.\"I can convey to you Syria's full determination to march on the way of peace within the framework of commitments and principles which were agreed upon,\" Moussa said.The ministers' remarks implied that Syria wanted a resumption of talks on the condition they were still based on the land-for-peace formula, whereby Israel returns occupied Arab land in exchange for peace treaties with its neighbours.Whereas the previous Labour-led government under Peres accepted this principle, the new right-wing government under Likud Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected it, saying Israel will keep Syria's Golan Heights, captured in 1967.There was no immediate Israeli response to Shara's offer. Israel wants talks to resume without pre-conditions.Peres' government suspended peace talks with Syria and recalled its peace team from Washington in March after four suicide bombings killed 59 people in Israel.The sporadic talks, which opened in Madrid in 1991, have been stalled over the fate of the Golan Heights, security arrangements and future ties.Syria wants a full Israeli pullback from the Golan and says security arrangements should be equal and balanced.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

These Phase 3 trials are the largest ever conducted in the area of subgingival anti-infective therapy, the company said.Analysis of trial results demonstrated three findings with respect to attachment level gain and pocket depth reduction, the two primary clinical parameters used to assess outcomes after treatment of periodontitis.First, ATRIDOX was statistically superior to placebo; second ATRIDOX was clinically equivalent to scaling and root planing; and third, both ATRIDOX and scaling and root planing were statistically superior to oral hygiene alone.", "label": ["C23", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GHEA"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Kandir's 1997 forecast of revenue and spendings projects an 0.8 percent primary surplus and an operational deficit of 1.07 percent, compared with an estimated 0.59 percent primary  and 1.38 percent operational deficit this year.The minister said Brazil's more restrained inflation had made the task of drawing up the 1997 budget simpler than in previous years.He also said that any amendments approved by Congress for additional outlays must be balanced by cuts from items included in the draft.Sen. Jose Sarney, president of the Senate, said he might seek to broker an interparty accord to block requests for additional funding from individual congressmen, according to a published report.Instead, each party would present its own collective proposal for additional spending, he told Invest News.Sarney said such an accord would help speed the passage of the budget by Congress, where it is typically becomes bogged down in a sea of requests for more spending.-- William Schomberg, Brasilia newsroom 5561 2230358", "label": ["E211", "E21", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Griggs expects the pressure to start building up on Tuesday with the National Association of Purchasing Management's report for August.\"The numbers that really matter are the August numbers, and the NAPM is one,\" Griggs noted. \"We ought to be looking at a rebound in the NAPM after the softness of July.\"The long bond sold off on Friday on news the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago's August index surged to 60.0 from 51.2 in July, clobbering market hopes for a third-quarter slowdown and leading analysts to revise their NAPM forecast upward.  In a shortened pre-holiday session on Friday, the 6-3/4-percent 30-year bond ended down 30/32 at 96-14/32 to yield 7.12 percent.\"The auto sales (on Tuesday) are going to be important as well because they were soft in July and people were wondering whether the consumer was still in the play,\" said Griggs who predicted the car sales will be fairly strong, reflecting the upbeat mood of the American consumer.Griggs also expected a strong August employment report on Friday. A Reuter survey puts August payrolls at up 244,000 with the unemployment rate at 5.3 percent.  \"This will paint the picture of a pretty solid third quarter shaping up, probably in the three-percent growth area, not very different than the first half, and not showing the kind of slowdown the Fed had been forecasting,\" Griggs added.\"This will shake the market's confidence that the Fed will not raise rates through the (November presidential) elections,\" he concluded.Goldman, Sachs and Co. senior economist Ed McKelvey said strong numbers will only heighten the debate within the Fed about the appropriate course of action at a time of solid growth void of blatant inflation gains.  \"If they (Fed officials) want to remain pre-emptive, they have to decide to act in advance of inflation, they have to decide whether this pace of growth is inflationary or not,\" McKelvey said.The Goldman, Sachs senior economist pointe dout that various wage measures \"make it hard to look at them without seeing an acceleration in wages.\"One factor Fed officials have been basing their slow-growth bet on is the back up in long-term market rates that usually dampen rate-sensitive sectors, such as housing, cars and durable goods.  \"If we keep on getting strong numbers and the Fed does not tighten, the market will tighten for them,\" one trader said while cautioning the impact of a market selloff may be far more restrictive on growth than a limited Fed move.With federal funds trading on target at 5-1/4-percent, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York refrained from open-market operations on Friday.

They will be able to access this powerful network directly for the first time this fall,\" Benjamin said in a statement.Sprint said the service, dubbed Sprint Internet Passport, will provide around-the-clock access to the network with a local phone call in 212 cities at first, which will rise to more than 300 by year-end.The offering compares with the services rolled out by AT&T and MCI, as well as regional Bell operating companies, earlier this year.AT&T's entry into the market early this year, which included some free access time, sparked a flurry of competition that sent shockwaves through the consumer Internet access business.In 1992, Sprint became the first long-distance company to offer commercial Internet service, and now offers access to more than 1,000 Internet service providers and to a host of other businesses.

As long as we were able to work, we lived.' said Kennedy, a Jew from Wroclaw now in Poland, who was deported to Auschwitz aged 15 and recruited there to work.Kennedy said he had returned to Germany for the first time since he emigrated to London in 1946 and that he had come expressly to call for the dissolution of IG Farben, which ran its own forced labour camp at Monowitz-Auschwitz.\"We want to publicise the scandal that this IG Farben is allowed to exist...the more pressure we put on the company, the more likely the company's assets will be liquidated,\" Peter Gingold, a member of the Association of Victims of the Nazi Regime told Reuters Television in Frankfurt.Police officers formed a chain to stop the protestors from blocking the way for shareholders. Some survivors, who were sold by SS concentration camp guards, to IG Farben shouted \"SS\" at German police as they tried to hold them back.Many German firms used slave labourers during the war but IG Farben, the world's fourth largest company until the end of the war, stood out by running its own concentration camp at Monowitz in Poland to ensure a regular supply of labour.The liquidation has been taking so long because of the company's fight to reclaim assets seized at the end of the war. Its shares, or liquidation certificates, are still traded.IG Farben in Abwicklung paid 30 million marks ($20 million) in compensation to the Jewish Claims Conference in 1957 but no compensation has been paid on an individual basis or to ex-slaves in Poland.Survivors' groups say that was insufficient.

U.S. Circuit Judge Paul V. Veimeyer said Tuesday the court would issue its ruling in the case at 2 p.m.At issue is Lloyd's plan to reorganize by reinsuring billions of dollars of liabilities into a new company called Equitas.It is asking its investors -- known as Names -- to help pay for Equitas and has offered to forgive some of their outstanding liabilities in return for an end to litigation and their association with Lloyd's.Lloyd's says investors must decide whether to accept or reject the plan by Wednesday because its ruling council meets on Thursday to determine whether the plan can be declared unconditional.Such a declaration is needed because the market must meet solvency tests with British regulators by the end of the month, with the New York insurance department by Sept. 1 and with the U.S. Treasury by Sept. 30, according to Lloyd's motion to appeal.More than 75 percent of Lloyd's 34,000 investors worldwide have already accepted the offer. But Lloyd's has said the reorganization plan cannot proceed without the consent of its American investors.If it were to lose the appeal, a Lloyd's spokesman said it would be forced to reconsider its alternatives and consider contingency plans.It said in its motion that the British government, which regulates Lloyd's, has reviewed the reorganization plan and has concluded that it is critical to Lloyd's survival.It also said that excluding American Names, or even some of them, from reinsurance into Equitas was not possible.\"Failure to satisfy the solvency tests would lead inexorably to 'run-off,' in which no new policies could be issued and the sole focus of the market would be the settlement of claims made on existing policies,\" it said.In run-off, administrative expenses would increase, syndicate assets would be frozen and policyholders would file lawsuits, Lloyd's said in the motion.", "label": ["C11", "C12", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

But sales in Germany fell 2.1 percent to 110,262 vehicles.The carmaker, invigorated by its award-winning A4 vehicles, said its share of the German car market in the first half of the year fell to 5.8 percent from 6.4 percent.Management Board Chairman Herbert Demel said Audi's nominal German market share would likely fall in 1996 to about 6 percent from 6.3 percent in 1995.But he expected 1996 sales to climb more than 5 percent and said 1996 would be \"a strong year\" in Germany. He noted that 1995 was \"an even stronger year\" in the domestic market due to the new the A4.Seeking to expand its international presence, he said Audi will announce in a few years plans for two or three foreign finishing plants but has ruled out a U.S. plant for now.\"You can be sure that plans for two or three new plants will announced in the next few years,\" Demel said in an interview with Reuters.He said Brazil, where parent company Volkswagen has extensive operations, and India were \"interesting candidates\" but said there would be no new plant in the United States before 2000.\"We are thinking about several potential sites, but we could imagine building where VW is currently located,\" he said.\"We want to do everything to build as many Audis in Germany as possible and also build as many vehicles in foreign countries as needed,\" he said. \"One must build cars as close to the market as possible.

The European launch of the A3 is set for early September.Demel declined to predict potential investment in new plants, which would likely assemble car pieces from other countries, but said it would likely be self-financed.The foreign expansion is also aimed at reducing Audi's exposure to the strong mark, which burdened 1995 profits by about 300 million marks ($203 million).

{"token": "Japanese game maker Sega Enterprises Ltd. said Wednesday it had decided to ban the use of software depicting sexually explicit and excessively violent scenes for its television game machines.Sega, fearing that it may lose control over the content of the software for its sophisticated game machines, wants to protect it and the industry's image from criticism as video game users increase in line with the development of more sophisticated machines, a Sega spokesman said.Although Sega is the first to impose tighter standards on the type of software it will allow for its game machines, major software makers agree that sex and violence in software is a looming problem and have set up an industry body to monitor that issue as well as others.In Japan, people have so far not been as vocal about criticising the use of sex and violence in computer and television game software as they have been in the United States and Europe.Sega spokesman Munehiro Umemura said the company would eliminate its adult-category games, including sexually explicit graphics, and impose stricter standards for games recommended for those over 18 years old from October.Under the new rule, photographs and animated pictures of naked women will not be allowed. Figures in swimming suits or underwear will not appear in any games for those under 18 years of age.\"The development of 32-bit and 64-bit game machines has made expressions more realistic and precise computer graphics possible,\" Umemura said.\"The variety of game programmes as well as the customer base is expanding sharply these days. We need to consider more about younger children, or the healthy development of the industry will be jeopardised,\" he said.Confusing distribution channels, such as difficulty in separating sales counters for children and adult games, has also prompted Sega to do away with sexually explicit games, he said.Other game makers, such as Sony Computer Entertainment and Nintendo Co., have relied on their own code of ethics that bans sexually explicit content in their software.Sony said it had already banned figures of nude women from appearing in its PlayStation software. It has also put a warning seal on programmes which depict violent scenes, a spokeswoman said.Early this week, the Computer Entertainment Software Association, a software makers' group comprised of 90 member firms, decided to formulate a code of ethics to keep sex and violence out of their software.The code, to be set as early as this autumn, would have to be followed by all member firms, including the major listed ones such as Square Co., Konami Co. and NAMCO Ltd.\"It's not desirable that adult or violent scenes appear in such household games,\" the association's spokesman Takuji Kanda said. \"We hope as many makers as possible will join our organisation,\" he said.So far, about half of the mainstream software makers have become members of the group out of some 400 firms engaged in software development for video games and compact disc read-only memories.About 200 firms which specialise in video and computer programmes targeted at adult customers have yet to become members, he said.", "label": ["C11", "C21", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

President Enterprises is Taiwan's biggest investor in China.On Wednesday, Kao urged Beijing to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded ties.The talks were suspended last year after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's landmark trip to the United States.Beijing has viewed Taiwan as a rebel province since the Nationalist government collapsed on the mainland and fled to the island in 1949. China insists Taiwan is not entitled to official links with other states.China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan to lift a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links between the two sides. Last week Beijing unilaterally announced a set of regulations to pave the way for direct links.Taiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links since 1949. Indirect trade and investment has been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong.Many Taiwanese business executives, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.", "label": ["E512", "E51", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Fighting spread to Bosnia when its Moslem-led government broke away in 1992.Rebel minority Serbs armed by Milosevic seized almost a third of Croatia in the 1991 war but lost almost all of it to a Croatian government army counter-offensive over U.N. truce lines a year ago.Eastern Slavonia, the last Serb-held enclave in Croatia, is to revert to Croatian government rule next year after a transitional period under U.N. administration.By signing a normalisation treaty with Zagreb, Belgrade would definitively renounce its claim to oil-rich Eastern Slavonia which abuts the Danube River border with Yugoslavia.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

One that should take us to new highs,\" said Allen Sinai, chief economist Lehman Brothers Global Economic Advisors.There was speculation that the German move, which was quickly followed by other central banks in European and Canada, might take some of the pressure off the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in the coming months.\"There's the expectation a further German cut will take the heat off other central bankers including our own,\" said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First.The Fed left interest rates unchanged at its meeting Tuesday, but some economists expect the rates to be raised after the Nov. 5th Presidential election.Recent economic data suggested that consumer spending and the labour market were heating up in August, although signs of a slowing manufacturing sector were seen as offsetting the growth signals.The German rate cut lifted the British stock market to a record close and other exchanges also posted solid gains.Analysts said the recovery in technology stocks after several weeks of battering boosted sentiment on Wall Street.\"I think the bear market in technology is over,\" said Alfred Goldman, technical research director at A.G.

He said building was funded by private charities including organisations from Canada and Sweden.He said the 150 square metre (1,600 square feet) building was part of a large project that would include a handicapped centre, a home for the elderly and a kindergarten.Palestinians regard East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.

{"token": "Germany, the self-appointed patron of a stable future European currency, on Thursday made clear that it would not be a party to political compromise in the creation of the Euro.In a two-pronged offensive against speculation that Europe might slacken its efforts to cut budget deficits, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said there was no room for laxity in meeting economic criteria for the planned common Euro currency.That view was restated by a senior German Finance Ministry official, Juergen Stark, who told a forum in Austria that the economic conditions set for entry to economic and monetary union (EMU) must not be diluted.\"There must not and will not be any weakening of the criteria,\" he said, according to the text of a speech.Germany's restatement of its hardline approach comes at a critical time, with a growing number of dissenting voices raised against the austerity measures that Europe must implement if it is to bring its budgets into line by a 1997 deadline.Countries which want to meld their currencies into the Euro from January 1, 1999, must meet tough conditions on inflation, currency, interest rates and public budgets in that year.Germany itself is by no means certain to reach the reference levels laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on deficits and debt, calling for a three percent and 60 percent maximum ratio to gross domestic product, respectively.But it has remained adamant that these levels must be seen as absolutes if the currency project is to succeed.In speeches, both Kohl and Tietmeyer focused on the importance of the new currency gaining credibility from the outset -- not only in financial markets but also from ordinary people, who are nervous of ceding the cherished deutschemark.They both rejected the suggestion that Germany's insistence on fiscal discipline before and after 1999 was some attempt to force a German way of thinking on its European partners by bringing its considerable economic power to bear.\"We know that the Euro must come and will come, at conditions which cannot be diluted as the trust of the public is at stake,\" Kohl said in a speech at a celebration on Wednesday evening to mark Tietmeyer's 65th birthday.\"Those looking at us from outside should not see us as crazy or slightly hysterical over this..,\" he added, noting that older Germans had suffered two bouts of hyperinflation.\"EMU is only possible as a low-inflation community, not just at its birth but down the years,\" Kohl said.\"When we say this, it is not just a routine comment from us. And it is certainly not an attempt to make others adopt German ways,\" he added.Tietmeyer, who has often been billed as opposing EMU -- a charge he firmly rebuts -- said he was in total support of European integration providing it had the right economic basis and ideally went hand in hand with deeper political union.\"The economic fundamentals are important and indispensable,\" Tietmeyer said. \"Stability...does not come of itself. You have to work for it. But it is worth fighting for.\"Germany faces an uphill struggle to reach the Maastricht targets. Bonn admitted on Wednesday that it would not be able to meet its planned budget deficit of 60 billion marks ($40.6 billion) in 1996 and coalition sources said on Thursday the actual figure could be more than 70 billion.In France -- the country viewed with Germany as an essential initial partner in EMU -- threatened strikes pose a new challenge to unpopular budget measures in spite of a deep-rooted political will to see EMU go ahead.Many other European countries, including Italy, a founder member of the integration movement, are judged by analysts to have barely any chance of meeting the conditions in time.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "G15", "G154", "GCAT", "M132", "M13", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Russian and Chechen commanders resolved disputes and finalised a truce brokered by Alexander Lebed in the rebel region on Tuesday, while a Lebed aide said President Boris Yeltsin would study the plans soon.An aide in Lebed's press office said documents outlining a \"comprehensive plan\" and an account of Lebed's weekend talks with separatist leaders would be passed to Yeltsin at five p.m. (1300 GMT).She said the president, on holiday outside Moscow, would \"possibly\" meet his security chief or talk to him by telephone.The Kremlin could not be reached for comment.Yeltsin, 65, named Lebed as his representative in Chechnya earlier this month, but he has seemed reluctant to meet him since Lebed on Sunday abruptly broke off talks with rebel commanders and flew to Moscow to get support for his peace plans.Lebed's peace proposals have not yet been spelled out, but he must try to bridge a chasm between the separatists' demand for a referendum on independence and Moscow's insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian Federation.Lebed's main achievement has been the sealing of a ceasefire with separatists. The rebels seized much of the Chechen capital on August 6 in a raid designed to embarrass the Kremlin before Yeltsin's August 9 inauguration for a second term.Russian commander Vyacheslav Tikhomirov and Chechen chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov said they had ironed out final difficulties on Tuesday and the truce would go ahead.\"There will be no more obstacles to the continuation of our task,\" Tikhomirov said following the final agreement, which will set up joint Russian-Chechen patrols in Grozny in preparation for the withdrawal of Russian troops by September 1.\"We gave each other our word that no provocations would become grounds for a breakdown of negotiations. \"Somehow in the end we got around to really acting on creating peace.\"Agreement had been delayed after a group of Chechens disarmed a Russian column on Saturday, but Tikhomirov said the seizure of the weapons would no longer hold up the talks.Interfax news agency quoted a rebel source as saying that, under the terms of the final agreement, the joint units would be deployed around Grozny around six p.m. (1400 GMT) on Tuesday.Tikhomirov said the pullout of Russian troops from some districts of southern Chechnya, which has continued since Sunday, would be completed on Tuesday. Other districts would be free of Russian troops by Wednesday or Thursday.Both sides said the truce was broadly holding. The Russian military said three servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight, well below \"normal\" casualties.Lebed's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20-month conflict. But it could falter if momentum for a final political settlement lapsed.Yeltsin's slowness in meeting Lebed prompted speculation that the president, who sent troops to crush Chechnya's bid for secession in December 1994, could be too unwell to deal with the matter or that he was waiting to see if Lebed failed.\"Boris Yeltsin has decided definitively to distance himself from the activities of Alexander Lebed in Chechnya until events there reach a final phase,\" Sevodnya newspaper said on Tuesday.Yeltsin has been seen twice on television since he was reelected in July, fuelling rumours that two heart attacks last year have weakened his grip on affairs of state.Aides have dismissed such speculation, insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign.In Grozny, the separatists are setting up local government agencies, consolidating their grip to the open dismay of some Russian soldiers who have spent over a year defending the city.Lebed came under fire in Moscow from Doku Zavgayev, the head of the pro-Moscow Chechen government, who accused him of handing power to \"terrorists\" in his agreements with the Chechen rebels.Zavgayev has largely been sidelined by Lebed's peace mission and his popular support in Chechnya is uncertain.

{"token": "As the manager of one of the most successful mutual funds over the last eight years, Michael DiCarlo makes no apologies for this year's poor results at John Hancock Special Equities Fund.The small-company fund has finished among the top 20 percent of all funds in its class three of the past eight years, and two times Special Equities has been in the top five percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services.In June, Smart Money magazine named DiCarlo one of the seven best fund managers in the business.  However, year-to-date, the $1.8 billion fund has lost 0.29 percent, ranking it 365th out of 374 small-company funds which have gained an average of 10.57 percent over that period, according to Lipper Analytical Services.So why has Special Equities dropped off this year?DiCarlo said the fund often sputters at the beginning of the year, only to recover in the late summer and fall.\"It's hard to believe, actually, but it does seem to be seasonal to some extent,\" he said in an interview with Reuters.  DiCarlo said the \"nose-bleed\" price-to-earnings ratios of many of the fast-growing companies he buys run an annual cycle of intimidating investors the first half of the year, then drawing a crowd the second half when the company meets its strong growth forecasts.\"Then at the beginning of the year, they go through a healthy consolidation of the gains they made in the third and the fourth quarter,\" he said.  Others may blame the slump on DiCarlo's decision to leave John Hancock and start his own hedge fund, DFS Advisors, which is expected to be up and running in October with between $100 million and $200 million in assets.However, DiCarlo, who has agreed to run Special Equities for another five years, said he has more time than ever to run the fund since he left behind his executive duties at John Hancock.  Special Equities' high concentration in just 80 to 100 stocks, with about 45 percent invested in computer software and services and telecommunications companies as of July 31, can prove to be a volatile mix, said John Teall, an analyst with Lipper.\"He's willing to take big positions. If it works, it's great, and if it doesn't it can be more painful,\" Teall said. \"Certainly, he has a great long-term record.\"Special Equities has returned 193 percent or 24.02 percent annually over the last five years ranking it fifth out of 93 small-company funds, according to Lipper.  Technology shares, including one of DiCarlo's favorites, America Online Inc, took a spill in May, June and July when the long-awaited correction finally arrived. America Online fell from a year-high of $71 in early May to just $31 on Tuesday on fears the Internet would displace the online service provider.  \"America Online is, in my opinion, a screaming buy at the price level it is at today,\" he said. \"You have got to realize that technology stocks are in the middle of a secular bull market that's going to last at least through the end of this decade, perhaps even longer. The nineties will be known as the decade when you had to own technology.\"DiCarlo held about 1.1 million shares at the end of July, the most recent date figures are available, accounting for about 2.1 percent of his portfolio.

By Wednesday afternoon, 66.7 percent of U.S. members had accepted.\"The level of acceptances speaks for itself. Members have made their views toward the reconstruction of Lloyd's abundantly clear,\" Lloyd's Chairman David Rowland said in a statement.Earlier, a Lloyd's spokesman said acceptances from U.S. investors in the market, known as Names, had flooded in overnight.Almost half of the 2,700 U.S. Names had until Tuesday night held off, with only 53 percent accepting by then.This followed a decision by a federal appeals court in Baltimore Tuesday to overturn U.S. District Court Judge Robert Payne's ruling in Richmond, Va., Friday to allow U.S. Names more time to consider the plan.Payne granted an injunction giving U.S. Names more time to consider the plan and ordered Lloyd's to provide further information by Sept. 23. On Tuesday, the panel of judges in Baltimore sent the case back to the lower court with orders to dismiss it.Rowland said he acknowledged that many overseas members had deferred their acceptance in the light of the Virginia court judgment and the subsequent Baltimore ruling.Over the last few days, evidence of support for the Lloyd's proposals among its 34,000 investors worldwide has grown. On Tuesday evening, acceptances totalled 82 percent, compared with 75 percent Saturday.Wednesday's noon deadline for accepting the 3.2 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) recovery plan, under which Lloyd's proposes that Names pay to help reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities into a new company called Equitas, was extended to give all a chance to respond.Rowland said Wednesday afternoon that under the circumstances it was \"fair and proper\" to exercise flexibility in pushing back the deadline for acceptances.Lloyd's said that any formal, longer-term extension would be subject to a decision by its council at a Thursday meeting at which it would consider \"the prospect of declaring the settlement offer acceptances unconditional.\"This extension will give the market enough time to collect the convincing majority of acceptances, especially from U.S. Names, which it needs to prove its own solvency.Lloyd's problems began in the 1980s when a destructive combination of negligent underwriting, poor investment advice and a sequence of natural disasters conspired to bring about losses of several billion pounds.Long-standing Names were for the first time in their lives suddenly faced with the prospect of unlimited losses.The market is due to submit figures to Britain's Department of Trade and Industry next week in an annual solvency test, and file with the U.S. Treasury and New York Insurance Department later next month.Equitas may lift off in two weeks if all goes as planned. The recovery plan's success increasingly looks likely, but another challenge by U.S. Names has not been ruled out.However, U.S. legal sources said overnight that while U.S. investors could in theory attempt to challenge Tuesday's order, it would be difficult to do so successfully.Despite that, one U.S. Name, Kenneth Chiate, who is chief negotiator for a group known as the American Names Association, said he expected U.S. Names to appeal the Baltimore ruling.", "label": ["C12", "C16", "C17", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "President Bill Clinton gave millions of Americans a raise on Tuesday, signing into law a bill to increase the minimum wage for the first time in five years, by 90 cents an hour to $5.15 over two years.\"For many this bill will make the difference between their ability to keep their families together and their failure to do so,\" Clinton said as he signed the bill surrounded by workers who earn the minimum wage and their children.\"It's about time they got a reward and today they'll get it,\" the president added.The bill boosts the wage typically paid to unskilled workers in restaurants and stores by 50 cents to $4.75 on Oct. 1 and by 40 cents to $5.15 on Sept. 1, 1997. It sugarcoats the pill for the mostly small businesses that will pay the higher labour costs by handing them $22 billion in tax breaks over 10 years, paying for this in part by reimposing a 10 percent tax on airline tickets.The passage of the minimum wage boost is a victory for Clinton, who called for the measure when he ran for president in 1992, and his fellow Democrats who forced the legislation through Congress over the objections of many Republicans.\"This is a truly remarkable piece of legislation. It is pro-work, pro-business and pro-family,\" Clinton said in the elaborate signing ceremony on the White House south lawn.\"This is a cause for celebration for all Americans of all parties, of all walks of life, all faiths,\" he added. \"We have made this a real season of achievement for America.\"But there were no leaders of the Republican-led Congress that passed the minimum wage legislation on hand as Clinton signed the bill into law.In a ceremony with great fanfare including music played by the U.S. Marine band, Clinton walked to the podium through two parallel columns of American flags with the White House perfectly framed behind him.After signing the bill with minimum wage workers and their children posed around him, he carried a small girl in a pink dress in his arms as he walked through the crowd greeting people.", "label": ["C13", "C42", "CCAT", "E14", "E41", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GJOB", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Large wooden crosses still stand on Bucharest's boulevards in honour of those killed in Romania's violent six-year-old revolution.They are a stark reminder of the era of political violence -- the years of brutal repression, the death by firing squad of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and the bloody miners riots engineered by former communists.All that is behind us now, say Romania's politicians as they gear up for the November 3 presidential and parliamentary elections, the third of the post-communist era.But while they promise their aggression will only be verbal -- a pledge Western diplomats find credible, although there is no precedent for power changing hands peacefully -- most agree Romania has not yet turned its back on the past.For reformists the election is another chance to rescue the lost opportunity of the Christmas revolt of 1989, which former communists, including current President Ion Iliescu, used to reinvent themselves and gain power.The diehards hope the vote will slow Romania's already sluggardly reform of its Soviet-style command economy, help protect workers from the full shock of transition to a free market and cement the privileges of the ruling elite.\"Romania is at a turning point again,\" said Dorel Sandor, of Bucharest's Centre for Political Studies.\"We can continue in the old way, of fragmentation, undermining each other and blocking initiatives, or we can try to change something at last through working together.\"The stakes are high for this under-developed country of 23 million people, largely of Latin origin, hemmed into the eastern Balkans by Slavic nations and Hungary.If the elections deliver a stable centrist government, with no links to the extremists who keep afloat the ruling coalition of the leftist Party of Social Democracy (PDSR), it would boost Romania's hopes of NATO and European Union membership.If Romania finds itself with a rocky minority government or one unpalatable to the West it could become more isolated, starving the reform process of the foreign investment needed to prevent the economy's collapse.Iliescu launches his candidacy on August 28 and the parties are preparing for the campaign start on September 4.Amid the electoral rhetoric commentators agree on one thing that has changed since the 1992 poll. The PDSR, in power since 1989 and comorised largely of ex-communist functionaries, for the first time feels it could lose.\"After the (June) local elections where they fared badly the PDSR feels vulnerable, which they never felt before,\" said one Western diplomat. Corruption scandals and voter weariness at economic mismanagment are at the root of PDSR unpopularity.Polls show no party winning an outright majority. With power in parliament dependent on coalition strength, the opposition Democratic Convention (CDR) and ex-premier Petre Roman's Social Democratic Union (USD) scent victory.\"A new situation has been created in which it has become possible not only to dethrone but even to eliminate the PDSR from the game of setting up a coalition government,\" leading commentator Silviu Brucan wrote in the daily Adevarul.Unfortunately for presidential hopeful Roman and CDR candidate Emil Constantinescu, polls suggest Iliescu will retain his post, although it will take two rounds of voting.That raises the possibility of a split administration, with presidential losers taking key legislative positions.\"The question is whether Iliescu and Constantinescu can live with each other,\" said Sandor. \"They will need to have a larger vision of how to unite forces and Romania could then be a stable country with an efficient parliament.\"It is unclear if the good will for such a compromise will exist after what is expected to be a hard-fought, muck-raking campaign with graft, jobs and the woeful economy hot issues.Iliescu's message of stability and caution is expected to be welcome in the countryside, where the PDSR should also fare well, boosted by the fact state television, largely supportive of the government, is the only station available.In the cities and areas where Romania's large Hungarian minority predominate, anger at falling living standards and a relatively free media should boost the opposition, which largely supports quicker market reforms.The PDSR hopes Iliescu's popularity will drag it up in the polls, although some commentators suggest the President, realising the PDSR is unpopular, may be distancing himself.That might prompt the PDSR to desperate measures, some commentators say, rather than allow the opposition into power where it can unlock the files of the intelligence services and properly investigate the enrichment of leading party officials.Analysts predict expensive pre-election pledges from the government, which will further harm the already over-stretched state budget, and a feverish atmosphere of intrigue over the next few months as parties large and small jockey for position.\"There is already so much political touching and feeling going on its like the back seat of a car at a drive-in movie\" said one Western diplomat.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "By Nicholas Doughty, Diplomatic CorrespondentNATO now looks likely to keep troops in Bosnia well into next year, following the international community's decision to postpone municipal elections that had been due in the next few weeks.Diplomats say the postponement, announced in Sarajevo on Tuesday, also allows Western governments to counter some of the sharp criticism of their Bosnian policy since the Dayton agreement which formally ended the war last December.U.S. and European officials say it has been clear for months that the door is open for an extension of the NATO peace force's mandate, which is due to expire at the end of this year. But no decisions have been taken so far.Some of the 60,000-strong force will start leaving next month although NATO allies have agreed that much of it will not start pulling out until December. The last troops could not be withdrawn until next March at the earliest, officials say.But the forthcoming U.S. presidential election and other factors mean that that there is almost no public discussion of the need for a \"follow-on\" force that most allies feel will be needed to make sure the shaky peace agreement holds.One of NATO's main tasks has been to provide a secure environment for the country's first post-war elections on September 14. Municipal elections are now unlikely to be held before April or May next year and will need similar security.\"It was already likely that we would need some sort of successor force beyond the end of this year,\" said one European diplomat, who asked not to be identified.\"We will need to be there for the municipal elections, so the postponement makes a NATO extension well into next year that much more likely.\"A NATO diplomat said: \"We don't want an open-ended commitment to Bosnia but if we walk away and then it goes bad, we'll only have to go back in again.\"Western military officials say a successor force will be smaller but still needs to be well-equipped and tough.European allies have privately insisted that U.S. troops must be involved, to avoid any repeat of the damaging transatlantic disputes that were the hallmark of Western policy on Bosnia after war erupted in 1992.European diplomats say that this point has been accepted in Washington but that the U.S. administration has to keep a low profile until after the presidential election in November.President Bill Clinton wants to avoid making any fresh commitments on U.S. troops in Bosnia, which could be unpopular and provide ammunition for Republican challenger Bob Dole.The postponement of Bosnia's municipal elections, amid allegations of electoral manipulation by the parties, is a formal acknowledgement that there are serious problems in rebuilding Bosnia as a civil society.There has been criticism of Western policy from human rights groups and from the media, arguing that conditions simply do not exist in Bosnia for free and fair elections.Critics say the United States and its allies have simply pushed ahead with election plans so that they can declare democracy has been achieved and pull their troops out of Bosnia.The chief U.S. negotiator on Bosnia, John Kornblum, used the postponement of municipal elections to counter some of that criticism on Tuesday. Speaking in Washington, he said the decision showed \"there are clear rules for holding these elections and that violation of them...will not be tolerated\".Nevertheless, the other elections in Bosnia for cantonal assemblies, separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments, a national House of Representatives and a three-man Presidency will go forward as planned on September 14.Critics have argued that these will only reinforce the existing powers of dominant Serb, Moslem and Croat political parties, rather than build genuine democratic institutions.A study published this month by the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said the Dayton peace agreement had failed to create a space for more moderate political voices in Bosnia.\"The elections seem likely to herald a period of instability...NATO's second year in Bosnia may be more difficult than the first,\" it said.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDEF", "GDIP", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "China is unlikely to need to buy rice on the international market to make up for flood damage to domestic crops, Far East traders said on Tuesday.No China inquiries for rice were reported by traders in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand.\"As far as large demand from the (central grain) reserve, COFCO (China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import Export Corp) or the grain bureaux goes, I rule it out,\" said a Chinese trader in Shanghai.China's Futures Herald newspaper, quoting State Grain Reserve Administration statistics, said on Saturday that although flood damage had reduced the early rice harvest and was likely to slow planting of late rice, total output for 1996 was expected to be unaffected.This is because China has increased the area under rice cultivation this year, the newspaper said, adding that the reduction in the early harvest should not have a significant effect on the total grain harvest due to higher production of other crops, it said.Rice imports could not go ahead without central government approval, and the process of issuing quotas and licences could take weeks or even months, trading sources said.The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said at the weekend that flooding in Hunan, one of China's major rice-growing provinces, had prevented farmers from planting rice for the autumn harvest and could force them to depend on food aid until next summer.\"Many farmers lost the season's first crop of rice in the floods and were unable to plant for the second harvest, leaving them dependent on food aid until their next crop, in one year's time,\" said Thorir Gudmundsson.\"For the second crop, they need to plant in July, and it is now mid-August,\" he said.The notion that China might need to import rice to meet demand provided some underlying support to rice futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) on Monday.The CBOT September price closed up 5-1/2 U.S. cents per cwt at $10.16.Chicago rice futures have been underpinned by a recent U.S. report that China bought 20,000 tonnes of Vietnamese white rice for prompt July shipments and that additional purchases were expected.But very little movement in domestic Chinese rice prices has been seen over the past three months, traders said.\"To be convinced that China will buy some rice, I have to get confirmation from the market -- but so far the market has not done anything, prices are steady,\" one Asian trader said.Traders in China quoted domestic prices at 2,200-2,300 yuan ($265-$277) a tonne for low quality long grain rice; 2,600-2,700 yuan ($313-$325) for high quality long grain rice; up to 2,800 yuan ($337) for low quality short grain rice; and 3,000 yuan ($361) for high quality short grain rice.More than 500 people were killed by the July floods in Hunan alone, with the national death toll from floods and typhoons surpassing 2,700, according to the government.Applications for rice imports would have to traverse China's multi-layered bureaucracy, trading sources said, though the procedure could be speeded up in times of emergency.The State Planning Commission (SPC) would issue a national quota, which would then be allocated to provincial SPC offices, which would then distribute the quota to trading companies, trading sources said.Rice, along with wheat, corn and soybeans, is considered a strategic grain and is thus tightly regulated.Hunan grows more than 22 percent of China's total early rice crop. Losses to the rice crop in the central province have been estimated at 2.4 million tonnes, accounting for most of the 2.6 million tonnes of Hunan's total grain losses.About 90 percent of China's early rice crop of 50 million tonnes is grown in Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. China has three rice crops a year.A Chinese analyst predicted earlier this month that the flooding could cut early rice output by between 10 and 20 percent. This would reduce the total 1996 rice crop by up to four percent for a total output figure of about 180 million tonnes.China's rice production in 1995 was 179 million tonnes according to figures from the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corp.", "label": ["C21", "C24", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Britain's fast-liberalising natural gas market takes another step forward on Sunday with the introduction of a stringent new code regulating market users.Britain, which launches the second stage of its Network Code gas shipping rules at the weekend, is the first country in Europe to start deregulating its gas market. The rest of the continent is watching with interest.\"It's incredibly high in the priority of every European utility to keep an eye on what's going on in the UK,\" said gas analyst Julian Kennedy at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.Phase two of Britain's Network Code gas shipping rules, known as the \"hard landing\" for the tight conditions it applies, comes into force on September 1 with the possibility of stiff fines for companies which do not observe its terms.But whether or not it is possible to tell if companies are honouring the terms depends on availability of accurate data about volumes of gas entering and leaving the system, and there are still many question marks about this.\"Quality and timeliness of data are vital to the success of the hard landing,\" says Bob Bruce, of Eastern Natural Gas who is also the chairman of the Gas Forum Network Code Working Group. According to Bruce, data provision may not yet be sufficient to allow the code to work smoothly.\"That fact is acknowledged by (industry regulator) Ofgas to be material to pipeline users' performance under the hard landing,\" he said.Deregulation in the gas market so far means that any licensed company can deliver gas to any business using more than 2,500 therms a year. This compares with a typical household's consumption of 650 therms a year, and allows most small businesses to shop around.And in one pilot region, the southwestern counties of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, householders can already buy gas from any supplier. This scheme will be extended to cover the whole country by 1998.But while there are now many competing gas suppliers, there is only one transporter: TransCo, the pipeline arm of British Gas Plc, and shortly to become a separate company as British Gas demerges.And it is to regulate dealings between TransCo and shippers, or users of the National Transmission System (NTS) as the pipeline system is known, that the Network Code exists.Its most important provision is that users of the National Transmission System must ensure that offtakes - gas leaving the system to customers - are balanced by inputs, or deliveries to the NTS at coastal landing points, known as beach terminals.And under the hard landing this balancing must now be done daily. This is the main difference between the hard landing and the old \"soft landing\", in force from March 1 until now, under which penalties have been applied monthly, so allowing participants ample time to correct imbalances.Failure to balance will result in financial penalties. The more extreme the level of imbalance, the higher the penalty.Wood Mackenzie's Kennedy said he doubted other countries would try to deregulate to the same extent as Britain, allowing liberalisation of the market right down to householders.The Netherlands and Germany are taking the lead on deregulation eleswhere in Europe. The Netherlands published a White Paper discussing market liberalisation late last year, although no further progress has since been made and competition was only expected to apply to bulk deliveries.And Germany's economics minister Guenter Rexrodt announced on Friday that Germany is preparing a bill to end regional monopolies for electricity and gas supplies. The bill is expected to be ready by September 25.Kennedy says that competition in Germany is not expected to go further than the level of regional distribution companies, or for competition in deliveries to city gates, restricting it to bulk deliveries as in the Netherlands.Gas is growing in importance in Europe's energy balance partly because of the huge availability of supply, with many new projects coming onstream in the next few years from Algeria, Russia, Norway, and Britain, and partly for environmental reasons.European consumption is now around 377 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year, but availability will jump by 90 bcm by 1999.", "label": ["C34", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The unit also has gained ground on the crosses at 85.64/5.74 yen against Tuesday's late 85.09 level and 58.0 in trade-weighted terms verses 57.8 previously.The dollar flopped to a low of US$0.7854 in early morning dealings as stale longs sold on comments by Prime Minister John Howard that he was hopeful of a further cut in official interest rates.But solid demand, including fund interest, backed by widespread talk of more samurai issues saw the currency shrug off the rate cut comments and chart steadily higher over the afternoon.  The move also set off a round of stop-loss buy orders, said one trader, who saw the Australian dollar trading in a US$0.7900-40 range for the remainder of the afternoon.He noted there was some selling interest at US$0.7925.S&P's positive outlook for Australia's offshore ratings and affirmation of domestic ratings was widely unexpected but has helped set a bullish tone, traders said.Economists, too, backed the S&P move as a boon for the currency.  \"It probably tends to alleviate any concerns that (Federal government) policies may lead eventually to a pick up in the current account...so it does look as if we're going to have a reasonably robust Australian dollar over the course of the near term,\" UBS Australia Ltd economist Stephen Roberts told Reuters.However, budget policies, inflation optimism and sober growth forecasts meant economists still saw pressure on the dollar emerging in the medium term.  Opposition party statements during the day that the budget was likely to pass through the senate mostly intact was welcomed by market participants as helping underpin the Australian dollar in the near term.\"At the end of the day, that was the concern with the budget over the next couple of weeks, whether or not the budget would go through the senate, and it looks like it might go through pretty unadulterated\" a trader said.-- Melbourne bureau 61-3 9286-1435", "label": ["M132", "M13", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

She talked of her husband's help, his plans, his programmes.Gone were the past references to \"we\" in describing administration policy. Instead  she spoke of the president's concern for families.\"The President hasn't forgotten that there are thousands of children languishing in foster care who can't be returned home.

My husband also understands that parents are their children's first teachers . ... my husband has always felt that all American families should have affordable health care,\" she said.She also turned a defence of her book, \"It Takes A Village,\" which Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole attacked at his party's convention, into a plea for her husband's re-election.\"For Bill and me, there has been no experience more challenging, more rewarding and more humbling than raising our daughter. And we have learned that to raise a happy, healthy and hopeful child. It takes a family. It takes teachers. It takes clergy. It takes business people. It takes community leaders. It takes those who protect our health and safety. It takes all of us,\" she said.Then she added to cheers: \"Yes, it takes a village. And it takes a president ... It takes Bill Clinton.\"She was asked afterwards about the continual attacks on her, a recent one being an accusation that she was behind the 30-hour delay in giving police a suicide note written by Clinton aide and her close friend, Vincent Foster.She said, \"There are so many of them (attacks). They come from all directions. I view it as partisan, politically motivated.\"Before she spoke at the convention, several speakers came to her defence, most notably civil rights leader Jesse Jackson.He had the crowd jumping to its feet when he declared: \"We must maintain with integrity the first lines of defence as they attack the integrity of the First Lady. It's beneath the dignity of American citizens.\"They applauded again when he declared, \"It's a moral obligation.

{"token": "Thousands of British troops with hundreds of armoured vehicles will pour across NATO's eastern border into Poland this month for a pioneering exercise that may lead other Western armies to hire Polish training grounds.British Brigadier David Montgomery said on Wednesday that his 7th Armoured Brigade would bring almost 3,500 personnel and 440 armoured vehicles, including Challenger 1 tanks, from bases in Germany for the August 30 to September 20 exercise.Britain has hired the 400 square km (154.5 sq mile) Drawsko area in the northeast, largest of several Polish post-Warsaw Pact training grounds, for Ulan Eagle '96.The British plan to return in 1997, while Polish officials say they will reinvest earnings to improve facilities.\"I would expect to have a brigade back here every year -- and this brigade every three years -- if things go as planned,\" Montgomery told a news conference in Warsaw.The vast Polish areas where Soviet armies trained before the 1989 fall of communism offer ideal conditions, without many of the constraints imposed by British and German civilian concern over noise. They are also relatively cheap.Montgomery said the exercise, which will not use live ammunition, would cost about 3.5 million sterling ($5.5 million) above the budget of his brigade, called the \"Desert Rats\" since the World War Two African campaigns of his distant relative Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.An exercise in its training facility in Alberta, western Canada, using live rounds but involving only 1,200 troops, would cost 5.5 million sterling ($8.5 million) because of transport and other expenses.Neither side in the deal, sealed by British Defence Minister Michael Portillo in Warsaw in June, will reveal how much Britain is paying Poland.Polish Defence Ministry spokesman Eugeniusz Mleczak said this was a commercial secret as Poland was in talks with other interested armies.Montgomery said Drawsko's terrain which was wooded, hilly and wet like much of Europe, unlike the much vaster Canadian ground which has only seven trees, or the smaller, heavily-booked German grounds which also lack forests.Drawsko offers a first chance since the Gulf War for a British armoured brigade to train almost as a whole.The exercise, simulating full-scale combat rather than peacekeeping, is purely British, although Polish forces are invited to observe closely and engineers will build a bridge.But Mleczak said it would serve Poland's military and political progress towards joining NATO.This goal is opposed by Russia, the heavily militarised Kaliningrad enclave of which borders Poland.Portillo, accompanied by the Polish and Ukrainian defence ministers, is to visit the exercise on September 3.The British and Polish governments have signed a detailed understanding on financial, legal, disciplinary, environmental and other issues and Poland's parliament is working on longer-term provisions for such exercises, Mleczak said.While the tanks will come by train, almost 700 non-armoured vehicles are to travel the 600 kms (400 miles) to Drawsko by road, the first major British army crossing of the former East Germany.This will be on a German holiday weekend, passing 36 road works on the way. \"They are predicting the biggest traffic jam this century,\" Montgomery said.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDEF", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Allan Fels said on Wednesday a weak merger policy could damage Australia's world competitiveness.In a lengthy rebuttal of what he called popular myths about the competition watchdog, Fels said mergers could play an important role in increasing industry efficiencies but stressed some mergers could raise input costs to exporters.\"A weak merger policy can damage our international competitiveness by facilitating anti-competitive mergers that raise input costs to exporters and import competitors,\" he told a Rotary Club of Melbourne luncheon here.  Fels described as myths the notions that the ACCC was all powerful, prevented firms from achieving the economies of scale needed to be world competitive, adopted a narrow approach to market definition and had changed its approach to bank mergers.He cited majority support among the chief executives of Australia's biggest companies for maintaining the current legal ban on mergers likely to substantially lessen competition.Some business leaders have been lobbying for a return to the old prohibition, which applied to mergers leading to market dominance.  Merger policy is especially important in sectors undergoing privatisation and deregulation, Fels said.\"It is essential that the pro-competitive effects of deregulation not be undone by anti-competitive mergers,\" Fels said, and gave an example in the power industry.\"If an electricity generation monopoly is split up into a number of competing generating businesses, a subsequent merger of them could be anti-competitive and inefficient,\" he said.\"Merger policy is critical to ensure competitive input markets for trade exposed sectors,\" he added.  \"The ACCC's priorities remain with mergers in the non-traded goods and services sector,\" Fels said.The ACCC has not blocked any mergers in sectors with substantial import competition in the past five years, he said.Fels said bank mergers were \"off the agenda\" of the ACCC, given the government's ruling that Australia's big six financial institutions could not merge before the outcome of the official Wallis inquiry into the nation's financial system.But it will examine each case on its merits at the time, he said. \"The commission's general approach...remains unchanged from a year ago,\" Fels added.  -- Melbourne bureau 613-9286-1421", "label": ["C13", "C181", "C18", "C34", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Battle lines hardened on Monday in the dispute betweeen Germany and the European Union over subsidies by the state of Saxony for auto maker Volkswagen AG.Germany and the EU each threatened to file fresh complaints in the case with the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, after Saxony did so on Friday.The tussle began in June when the European Commission approved only 540 million marks ($365.5 million) of a proposed 780 million marks in subsidies for VW to build two plants in the formerly communist east German state.Saxony premier Kurt Biedenkopf decided to hand over all the money anyway, because he said 23,000 jobs depended on it.German economics minister Guenter Rexrodt said Bonn backed Volkswagen's claim to all the cash, despite Brussels' contention this could start a spiralling war of subsidies.\"I believe VW has a right to this money, and that the two plants must be built in Mosel and Chemnitz,\" Rexrodt told German television.Initially, Rexrodt was less than pleased at Biedenkopf's action and had urged him to reach a compromise with Brussels, but he now appears to be digging in for a standoff.Compromise \"will be difficult, but nothing should be left untried. We need Brussels, Brussels needs us,\" he said.Rexrodt said he would recommend to the cabinet on Tuesday that Germany file a complaint in Luxembourg to clarify what role Brussels should play in monitoring Bonn's support for the rebuilding of the east, which still depends on massive help six years after unification.In Brussels, a spokesman told reporters the Commission planned no immediate action but would discuss the VW row at its September 4 weekly meeting, and would prepare to launch its own action in Luxembourg if the matter was not fixed to its liking.\"If legality is not re-established we are preparing everything so that if necessary the complaint on our side will be launched,\" he said.Rexrodt and EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert failed to resolve differences in a meeting last Friday, the day Saxony filed its complaint.Biedenkopf on Monday defended the decision to go to court.\"Putting a European Commission decision to the test in court is not the same as putting Europe in question,\" Biedenkopf told a gathering of VW managers.He said the Commission was not a government but a bureaucratic body. The relationship between Saxony and VW was one of cooperation, not blackmail as Van Miert suggested last week, he said, adding that Saxony was convinced the subsidies for VW were legal.Saxony was one of the most industrialised regions in Germany before World War Two, and suffered greatly under the communist east German government.

{"token": "A month-long slide in Polish T-bill yields caused by excess liquidity in the banking system during August's holiday season is expected to end at next Monday's primary auction, analysts said on Friday.They said uneven cash-flows during the holiday season created huge cash surpluses on bank accounts and pulled down money market rates and T-bill yields before this week's central bank drainages mopped-up most of the excess money.\"Sporadic cash-flows during the holiday season played havoc with the banking system's liquidity in August, but things are bound to normalise in September,\" said Radoslaw Radziszewski, deputy-chief dealer of Pekao SA.Some analysts even expected T-bill yields to inch up at Monday's 700 million zloty tender as the recent yield slide resulted from surplus cash spilling over from the money market rather than fundemental factors, such as dropping inflation.\"Yields should stabilise or inch up on Monday,\" said Andrzej Hirsz, senior T-bill dealer at Bank Gdanski SA.The National Bank of Poland sold 1.8 billion zlotys worth of 182-day and 273-day NBP-bills this week, which analysts said curbed the demand for T-bills in secondary trade and stuffed bank portfolios with the higher-yielding paper.\"Large-scale sales of NBP-bills eased the downward pressure on T-bill yields and build up bank portfolios -- which freed up more paper for non-banking sector clients,\" said Wojciech Labryga, T-bill dealer at Bank Handlowy SA.Analysts expected the average yield of the 52-week T-bill to hover around 19.5 percent, up from 19.46 at last Monday's auciton and the 13-week yield to inch up toward 19 percent from 18.65. The average 26-week bill yield was seen flat at 19.35.On Monday, the treasury will offer 450 million zlotys of 52-week T-bills, 150 million zlotys of 13-week bills and 100 million of 26-week paper.Analysts said that money market rates should stabilise next week around the last 14-day reverse repo level of 19 percent as banks start a new monthly reserve period.On the forex market the zloty was seen passively tracking dollar/mark changes while remaining within its present range between 1.6 and 1.9 percent from the trading band centre.\"The market woke up from its summer slumber this week, but it's still a little bleary-eyed going into September so I don't expect anything out of the ordinary next week,\" said Adam Roeske, forex dealer at Bank Gdanski SA.The zloty closed the week at 1.68 percent from the parity rate, slightly weaker than last week's close at 1.75 percent.It was at 2.7420/40 per dollar and at 1.8490/05 per mark.-- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700", "label": ["M131", "M13", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "By Gail Appleson, Law CorrespondentFormer talk show host Morton Downey, Jr. who has contracted lung cancer, is planning to sue the tobacco industry and the Kansas City, Mo., law firm of Shook, Hardy & Bacon, his lawyer said Thursday.Steven Kramer, Downey's New York City lawyer, told Reuters that the suit will be filed next month in New Jersey where Downey had lived and his show was produced.Downey now lives in Sherman Oaks, Calif.\"He wants to speak out to stop young people from smoking,\" Kramer said. \"He's very angry at the tobacco companies for not telling the truth about nicotine.\"The television personality's planned suit is the latest in a host of legal attacks on the tobacco industry. On Thursday alone, a key smoker's case is expected to go to an Indianapolis jury and Oklahoma became the 14th state to sue the industry to recoup health care costs.On Friday, the White House plans to announce its endorsement of Food and Drug Administration regulations aimed at keeping cigarettes away from children.Downey underwent surgery in July at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles, where doctors removed an inch-and-a-half diameter tumour from the upper lobe of Downey's right lung.Downey, 63, who used to be a strong advocate of smokers' rights, announced last month that his lung cancer was the result of 50 years of smoking.He recently made an anti-smoking public service announcement on behalf of the American Lung Association.Downey was dubbed \"The Mouth\" for his sometimes confrontational style, in which he often jabbed a cigarette in the faces of audience and guests on his popular syndicated TV show in the late 1980s.A former board member of the National Smokers Alliance, Downey resigned in January.\"I realised that the major tobacco companies were lying when they said they weren't adding dangerous levels of nicotine to cigarette tobacco. They're nothing but tobacco terrorists,\" he had said.Kramer said the Downey suit will be filed in Newark, N.J. federal court and will be brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act.Last week Kramer filed two other RICO actions against the tobacco industry in New York and New Jersey and will be filing a third Friday in Newark, N.J., federal court. He said he believes that the cases were the first to name Shook Hardy as a defendant.One suit was brought Aug. 12 in Newark federal court by Judy Mantel, a 61-year-old New Jersey resident who had smoked for 45 years and has been diagnosed with lung cancer.The other suit was filed Aug. 13 in the New York Supreme Court in Queens County by four plaintiffs one of whom wrote advertising copy about Kent cigarettes.The complaints alleged that the tobacco industry has lied about its knowledge of the addictive nature of nicotine.The suits also alleged that the defendants have controlled the amount of nicotine \"with the effect of creating and sustaining the addiction of plaintiffs.\"To support the racketeering claims, the plaintiffs cite internal industry documents and testimony by tobacco companies' chief executives in 1994 congressional hearings at which they denied that nicotine is addictive.The lawsuits also alleged that the Shook Hardy firm designated certain documents as confidential by wrongfully claiming that they were protected by attorney client privilege.", "label": ["C12", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

It is for a spacecraft.\"The United States, concerned over tensions in South Asia, has urged India to scrap the Agni as well as the short-range Prithvi, but India has said sophisticated weapons in neighbouring Pakistan and China require it to remain on guard.The United States is worried that such missiles could be used to carry nuclear warheads.On Tuesday in Geneva, U.S. disarmament ambassador Stephen Ledogar said India had blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) because \"New Delhi wants to maintain the Indian nuclear weapon option\".The Indian Defence Ministry said in an annual report on Monday that global pressures had mounted on India to scrap its missile programmes and abandon its option to build a nuclear bomb.The ministry said it would keep a constant watch on the development and stockpiling of missile weapons systems in the region.\"India will continue with its indigenous missile development programmes and also keep its options open on their deployment as warranted by our national security interests,\" it said.India, along with Pakistan and Israel, is a nuclear threshold state that has the capability to build nuclear weapons swiftly.

It was a concession to 300 protesters holed up in a Paris church supporting nine hunger strikers there and another in hospital.\"The enforcement of these laws naturally takes account of individual cases in a humane way to which the government has always given importance,\" the statement said.But it ruled out redrafting the 1993 laws and insisted: \"Clandestine immigration must be combated with the greatest firmness because it is a violation of the law.\"In another sign of a new conciliatory stance, Debre received three representatives of the protesters in their first meeting since the hunger strike began.The nine Africans fasting at the Saint-Bernard church had earlier pledged to continue their hunger strike after a 10th protester was taken to hospital with stomach pains.An official said that the court review would also focus on a legal kink which means some immigrants can be neither expelled nor granted residence permits.Aides said Juppe, who cut short his summer holidays on Tuesday, had consulted the speakers of both houses of parliament, leaders of the two parties in the ruling centre-right coalition, and Xavier Emmanuelli, junior minister for emergency humanitarian action.Bruno Gollnisch, a senior member of the far-right and anti-immigrant National Front, turned up unannounced at the interior ministry demanding to see Debre but was turned away.\"I wanted to express the French people's exasperation.

He ordered Seale, the rapid-speaking founder of the Black Panthers, bound and gagged because he wanted to defend himself and sentenced the other defendants and their lawyers to long prison terms for \"contempt of court\" because they broke into his comments from the bench and ridiculed him.The sentences were later overturned and an official commission accused the Chicago police of staging \"a riot\" against the protesters.Hayden, now a California state senator and establishment politician, joked, as did the other defendants who came back, that he was \"returning to the scene of the crime.\"The defendants climbed the stage with their families as a crowd of almost 1,500 cheered what was called, \"family values from the Chicago conspiracy.\"But Andrew Hoffman, 35, the son of Abbie Hoffman, the clown prince of Vietnam protests, refused to go on stage because, \"my father would not have done it.

{"token": "It may sound like a dull backwater but the role of compliance has again been thrust into the limelight as yet another respected financial institution was rapped by the authorities this week for breaking the rules.Compliance officials play a key role in banking and finance, ensuring procedures to safeguard against fraud and malpractice are adhered to from the back office to the board room.On Thursday British investment watchdog IMRO fined companies in the Robert Fleming group 700,000 pounds ($1.09 million) and Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) secured voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million from a Robert Fleming and Jardine Matheson joint venture.These punishments stemmed from compliance violations which also saw two individuals banned from the markets.A compliance officer at a top international investment bank, who did not want to be named, told Reuters the irregular dealing leading to the probe was \"as old as the hills\".And it was something the right checks and balances should have avoided. \"I'm surprised that something as old as this has cropped up again. It's the sort of thing that any compliance officer worth his salt should have his eye open for,\" he added.The joint IMRO and SFC investigation revealed that Colin Armstrong, a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management, had made profits for his own account by the late allocation of deals, thereby depriving client accounts.Compliance industry insiders said a number of red flags might have warned those in charge that something was amiss far earlier and thereby prevented much of the damage.Larger-than-life characters and big earners are often left to their own devices and not investigated until too late.Compliance officers first started appearing in London firms about 10 years ago, but the profile has changed significantly over this period, with many coming from the ranks of accountants and lawyers and seeking a career in the area.Industry sources say top-ranking individuals can now earn as much as 100,000 pounds a year, including bonuses, which although falling short of what dealers earn, is attracting good people.For a system of compliance with both internal and external rules and regulations to be wholly effective, the personnel involved not only need to be top notch, they must also have adequate resources and the full backing of senior management.\"The chief executive officer is personally accountable for compliance,\" the first source said. This means ensuring rules are not breached is not only in the interests of the firm, but also a question of self-preservation for the CEO.In the Robert Fleming Asset Management (RFAM) probe, RFAM's former chief executive Robert Thomas accepted he \"bore ultimate responsibility for the compliance failures...\". As a result Thomas had his registration with IMRO ended.In order to prevent the kind of dealing that Armstrong was engaged in, adequate separation between front and back offices, where the deals are struck and where they are processed, and strict rules on the use of personal accounts are critical.Market sources noted similarities with Barings, where one of the main criticisms was that Nick Leeson, the trader who stacked up the losses which led to its collapse, was responsible not only for executing trades but settling or matching them as well.This made it unlikely that any discrepancies in his trading would be uncovered in the back office, the sort of loophole regulators such as IMRO look for when they inspect firms.Insiders said the Jardine Fleming outcome was a good result for the British watchdog, which came under fire for its handling of previous cases. \"If you find a major problem you tell them. If it's a serious problem you tell them immediately, you certainly wouldn't sit on it,\" said one.And while the incidence of breaches may appear to be on the rise, it can be argued that the trend shows the net is tightening. But even the best systems will not prevent mistakes.\"Even the best of us make mistakes. If you are a large firm problems do arise, if you find them then you take remedial action. There will always be fools, crooks and incompetents,\" the first compliance source said.($1=.6420 Pound)", "label": ["C13", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The venture also has the companies combining U.S. corn flour operations and Mexican wheat flour operations into joint ventures.The partnership is subject to Gruma shareholder approval and a green light from Mexico's Antitrust Commission and other North American regulatory bodies.Gruma and ADM reckon the joint ventures will represent 25 percent of the $660 million U.S. corn flour market and a significant portion of the $1.5 billion Mexican wheat flour market.In an interview, Gruma Chief Executive officer Eduardo Livas said the companies hoped to beef up Mexican wheat milling, taking capacity from current levels of 250,000 metric tons per year to one million tons in five to seven years.\"We are going to focus first on utilizing the capacity and then expanding operations,\" Livas said, adding that the companies sought to reach a market share of around 25 percent to 30 percent.Livas said combining the companies' U.S. corn flour milling operations would take the total capacity up to 515,000 tons per year. Gruma already has capacity of 350,000 tons in the United States.Livas said they plan to divest one Texas corn flour mill and introduce Gruma technology and beef up capacity in two others in California and Kentucky. \"We plan to refurbish and bring them over to our technology so we can increase capacity,\" he said.He said Gruma planned to use almost all the $258 million payment from ADM to pay down short-debt.

{"token": "Umberto Bossi, firebrand leader of the separatist Northern League, on Wednesday hit back at magistrates who want to probe him for violating political ethics, saying he does not answer to judges of \"colonial Italy\".Magistrates in three northern cities sent documents to parliament on Tuesday seeking a green light to continue probes that could lead to Bossi being tried on charges of making threatening comments against political adversaries.Bossi, who on September 15 is set to lead a big demonstration at which the League has threatened to declare an independent northern \"state\", said the action by the judges was part of a plot to stop the movement.\"I don't give a damn. We know what the magistrature is. This is just a manoeuvre by colonial Italy,\" he told the Turin newspaper La Stampa in an interview.The magistrates want a parliamentary commission to decide if remarks Bossi made at rallies in 1995 are punishable as a crime or whether he has protection as a member of parliament under Italy's constitution. The commission is due to rule next month.They have accused Bossi of inciting people to commit crimes and making threatening remarks at political rallies last year, where he threatened that League members would seek out and punish those who voted for the far-right National Alliance.Ironically, the latest moves against Bossi -- who has hurled invectives against nearly everybody in the political spectrum -- came from magistrates in the north, his political stronghold.The cigar-smoking Bossi was not intimidated by the latest judicial moves against him.\"It's clear by now that there is a war of nerves between Rome and Padania,\" Bossi told an interviewer, referring to the name the League would give to an independent north.\"Either Padania wins or Rome and Italian colonialism wins. It will be a very tough battle because they have the police and the magistrates on their side.\" he said.\"We are Padanians. We prefer to die rather than live without freedom,\" he said.In another irony, Bossi is being probed in connection with a law that forbids the reconstitution of the Fascist party. Provisions of that law forbid \"anti-democratic\" methods or threats of violence as means to a political end.Commentators said it was the wrong way to stop Bossi. \"Evidently, there is no limit to the ridiculous in Italy,\" Piero Ostellino wrote in Milan's Corriere della Sera.Bossi's supporters immediately attacked the magistrature.\"These initiatives smack of pure fascism because they try to limit freedom of expression and thought,\" said Roberto Maroni, a former interior minister and leading member of the League.For most of an otherwise politically quiet August, Italians have been treated to a string of Bossi's outbursts.He accused the secret services of plotting to discredit him, branded the speaker of parliament a fascist and called for supporters to destroy relay stations of state broadcaster RAI.The League took root in the 1980s as a protest movement against the excesses of Rome central government and was instrumental in helping bring about the collapse of the old, corrupt political guard at the start of the 1990s.Its support has grown steadily and at the April election it polled 10 percent of the vote nationwide and over 30 percent in parts of the rich north of Italy.Since the vote, Bossi has dropped his calls for a federalist state, saying the only way forward was outright secession.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "After conquering the double-digit price increases of the early 1980s, central bankers and officials of major nations expressed confidence Friday that victory against inflation may soon be at hand.\"At the start of the 1980s, it was obvious that the high rates of inflation around the world were corrosive, and that the Federal Reserve and other central banks had to bring inflation down,\" Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said.\"Now, for the first time in at least a generation, the goal of price stability is within the reach of all the major industrial countries as well as a substantial number of others,\" he said.That upbeat description was echoed by other officials who, along with Greenspan, were attending a symposium in this mountain resort city on \"Achieving Price Stability.\"The symposium, an annual event that draws central bankers and prominent economists and officials from around the world, is sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., one of the branches of the nation's central bank.For the first time since the 1960s, inflation has remained below 3 percent in the United States for the past four years. It has also been hovering near 3 percent in many European countries and has been even lower in Japan.While celebrating the enormous strides against inflation, officials at the symposium for the most part steered clear of declaring inflation dead. Nevertheless, many described a sea change in the thinking about inflation compared to 15 or 20 years ago.Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, for example, pointed to Gallup polls on American opinions toward inflation between 1972 and 1982.During that time, between 30 percent and 80 percent of respondents viewed inflation as the most serious problem facing the country -- despite the Vietnam War in the early part of the period and the Cold War.\"However,\" Fischer said, \"the concern about inflation disappeared rapidly once the inflation rate dropped below 5 percent; inflation has not been a serious issue in the polls since 1986.\"Despite the successes, Fischer said periodic turbulence in financial markets during times when economic growth appears to be heating up suggests that some fears about inflation remain.Officials at the symposium also pointed out that with inflation so low, some new concerns have arisen, such as the need for central bankers to avoid becoming overly rigid in their zeal to combat inflation.In particular, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that a new trend among central banks of setting specific targets for inflation could lead to problems if taken too far in some cases.Citing the example of the 1987 stock market crash, he said, \"I doubt very much that it would be wise for central banks to consider (such shocks) only through the prism of their impact on inflation.\"Another concern discussed by a number of participants at the symposium was problems with measurements of inflation. Some experts have said that the Consumer Price Index, the main inflation gauge in the United States, may overstate true inflation by as much one or two percentage points a year.In other countries, such as Canada and Britain, the inflation gauges are believed to overstate inflation by half a point.While expressing concern about this issue, Greenspan stressed the need to find a way to appropriately gauge prices.\"Expectations about (inflation) can distort economic decision-making,\" he said, \"and as a consequence central banks need to be able to judge whether they are achieving their long-run objective of price stability.\"", "label": ["E12", "E131", "E13", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Despite little movement so far in the gold price, some analysts are suggesting investors beef up their portfolio of gold shares.Physical demand for gold is again poised to outpace supply in 1996 as it did last year, suggesting the shortfall will have to be met either from official or private sales or new forward hedge positions, they said.In such a scenario, gold should fall under the influence of supply and demand like any other commodity, the analysts said.  The shortage of physical gold, brought on by robust demand from the jewellery sector is being compounded by declining South African output, offset only partly by higher production from countries such as Australia.The current volatility in gold shares compared with the gold price has suggested to some that while gold may go up, shares may not necessarily follow.However, the emerging fundamental outlook for gold supplies is outweighing these concerns, at least for now, in the Australian market, where the local gold index has been relatively steady at just below 2000.  Bell Securities Ltd estimates South Africa's June quarter output slipped some four tonnes and is likely to fall further.South African output is in decline, despite new mines coming on stream, as mine fires and labor unrest take a toll.At least 24 miners have been killed and scores more injured in recent weeks in fights at four mines run by Gold Fields of South Africa Ltd. The violence has been blamed on differences between ethnic groups and rival unions.  Against this backdrop, brokerage Hartley Poynton Ltd believes physical demand is strong enough to place a rising floor under the gold price, which will set the scene for improvements.Producer hedging this year is unlikely to fill the gap between supply and physical demand, it said in a report.Money market managers and speculators are viewed as being the catalyst for such a move.Taking into account hedge positions, Hartley Poynton sees the potential for a shortfall of between 200 and 250 tonnes this year, equivalent to about one month's demand.  This, it said, implies higher gold prices.\"It is only a matter of time before the gold price moves upwards into the next trading range,\" it said.\"The bulk of evidence suggests investors should be overweight gold.\"-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 973-1800", "label": ["C15", "C152", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Japan's vehicle output rose in July as several car makers boosted production ahead of the launch of new models, but output is likely to stay flat or even fall in August before picking up again in September.Japan's vehicle production in July rose 9.5 percent from a year earlier to 953,010 vehicles, rebounding after falling the previous month, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) said on Thursday.\"The July gain was mainly because carmakers increased output in July ahead of the summer holidays in August and several makers began producing new models,\" a JAMA official said.Toyota Motor launched a remodelled Carina sedan on August 7 and Windom luxury sedan on August 21 while Mazda Motor introduced the Demio on August 26.Nissan Motor launched the Terrano Regulus sport-utility vehicle on August 27 and Daihatsu Motor put out the Pyzar compact wagon on August 28.Mitsubishi Motors will introduce a new Galant and new Legnum station wagon on Thursday and Toyota is scheduled to introduce its new Mark II mainstay luxury sedan and its sister model in early September.Some other makers are also expected to launch several new models later this year such as Honda Motor with its S-MX new light minivan.The weaker yen probably led to higher exports in July, which in turn helped boost vehicle output, the official said. JAMA said it expected Japan's vehicle exports in July to have risen 13 percent from a year earlier.\"In August, vehicle output is likely to be flat or just under year-ago levels because of the summer holidays. But in September and after, production is likely to mark gains because of the production of new models and ahead of possible strong domestic demand in January to March of 1997 ahead of an increase in the consumption tax,\" the official said.The Japanese government is planning to raise the consumption tax to five percent from the present three percent, effective April 1, 1997.Toyota's output jumped 16 percent from a year earlier to 310,165 in July, Nissan's rose 5.4 percent to 166,190, Mitsubishi edged up 0.1 percent to 108,439, Honda soared 18.5 percent to 94,944, and Mazda rose five percent to 63,593.JAMA also said Japan's overall vehicle sales, including 660cc minivehicles, rebounded in July.

{"token": "The Polish government has passed a regulation curbing the duty-free import of parts for car assembly, the Industry Ministry said on Wednesday, confirming earlier newspaper reports.Under the regulation, adopted by the government eight days ago, but not made immediately available to the media, auto firms must secure a permit from the Foreign Trade Ministry to import parts for assembly duty-free as of August 24.\"The regulation obliges firms importing duty-free parts for car assembly to obtain a permit from the foreign trade ministry,\" Industry Ministry spokeswoman Beata Nawracka told Reuters.Before then any company was automatically exempted from car parts duty if it assembled more than 1,000 units annually.Nawracka said the new rules were meant to limit small assembly plants run by companies, which want to profit on Poland's booming car market without investing much.The government's decision gave car producers little time to obtain the permit and some of them said the short notice would force them to temporarily pay duty, which they so far did not have to do.The Polish unit of Italy's Fiat Spa will probably have to pay the duty, ranging from 6.6 percent to 35 percent depending on a part involved, if it does not get the permit soon, company's spokesman Giovanni Prati said.\"(Without the permit) we will probably have to pay (the duty) so as not to stop production,\" Prati told Reuters, adding his firm has applied for the permission.The regulation has blocked the launch of the assembly of Hyunai cars by a recently created joint venture between Universal SA and South Korea's Hyundai, Universal spokesman Roman Janczewski said on Wednesday.He said trucks carrying parts for assembly of Hyundai's Accent model were being held up at the border. Universal and Hyundai plan to assemble 15,000 units annually.The foreign trade ministry said it would issue permits to eligible companies as soon as possible.\"It should be a matter of days,\" said the ministry spokesman Zbigniew Ostrowski.-- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700", "label": ["C13", "C311", "C31", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "A new controversy flared up over the French government's immigration policies on Wednesday when an Air France union said it would try to prevent the expulsion of a planeload of Africans.The CFDT union said it had learned of a government request to charter one of the state-owned airline's planes to fly illegal immigrants home to Tunisia, Niger and Zaire and called the plan \"a fresh violation of human rights\".\"The CFDT's Air France branch is intervening immediately, at all levels of Air France management, to prevent the airline's planes and staff from being used in such police operations,\" the union said in a statement.CIMADE, an organisation looking after immigrants, said the government was planning a second flight on Wednesday to Mali and Senegal.Leading human rights activists, including dissident former bishop Jacques Gaillot, joined in, asking pilots to refuse to fly the deportees.\"We...solemnly ask you to uphold the dignity of French aviation by refusing to be part of this ignominy,\" they said.The government's handling of the illegal immigration issue has become a hot topic since last week's police raid on a Paris church that had been occupied by some 300 Africans in a protest against France's tough immigration laws.Four of the Africans were deported at the weekend aboard a previously scheduled charter flight, and 66 have received expulsion orders, some 20 of which could legally be enforced at any time.Another 49 have been promised residence permits following a review of their cases on humanitarian grounds.Supporters of the Africans scheduled a march in Paris later on Wednesday, and the immigrants have called for a second demonstration on September 18 at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg in eastern France.Human rights groups, labour unions and the opposition Left have branded last week's police raid a human rights disaster.But most of the centre-right majority has praised the action while the far-right National Front has accused the government of being too soft an the problem of illegal immigrants.", "label": ["C42", "CCAT", "E41", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GJOB", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The only exception made was Palmeiras who contributed full-back Cafu and midfielder Flavio Conceicao.\"We try not to upset the clubs but as a result the national team ends up suffering instead and is still always expected to win,\" he said.Brazil play friendlies away to Russia on August 28 and Netherlands three days later.Unlike many countries, where the domestic programme is suspended on the weekend before a major international, Brazilian football carries on regardless.The tour is seen as the first step towards forming the team which the world champions will send to the 1998 World Cup in France. As holders, Brazil do not have to play in the qualifying competition.Zagallo included 32-year-old striker Bebeto and Barcelona's Ronaldo in the squad, despite a much-publicised row between them following the Olympic team's semifinal defeat by Nigeria at the Atlanta Games.Brazil had used most of their friendlies in the past year as warm-up matches for the Olympics, restricting Zagallo to players under 23.Bad results on the tour could put Zagallo's job in jeopardy following the failure to win the gold medal in Atlanta.The only uncapped player in the squad is central defender Goncalves who plays for Brazilian champions Botafogo.Squad:Goalkeepers - Carlos Germano (Vasco da Gama), Dida (Cruzeiro)Defenders - Ze Maria (Parma), Ze Roberto (Portuguesa), Andre Luis (Sao Paulo), Cafu (Palmeiras), Goncalves (Botafogo), Narciso (Santos), Ronaldo Guiaro (Atletico Mineiro), Andre Cruz (Napoli)Midfielders - Flavio Conceicao (Palmeiras), Ze Elias (Bayer Leverkusen), Amaral (Parma), Beto (Napoli), Giovanni (Barcelona), Leonardo (Paris St Germain), Mauro Silva (Deportivo Coruna), Sergio Manoel (Cerezo Osaka)Strikers - Bebeto (Flamengo), Donizete (Benfica), Jardel (Porto), Ronaldo (Barcelona)", "label": ["GCAT", "GSPO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

A senior official with Guthrie Corp said he was not certain whether the fire was still burning Tuesday afternoon, but said the blaze appeared to have been caused by lightning earlier in the day.The official said the town had been evacuated because of concerns that the fire might causing an explosion in the urea and diammonium phosphate fertilizers contained in the warehouse.He said the warehouse contained about 1,000 tonnes of soybeans, corn gluten beans and fertilizer, and that the building's total capacity was between 20,000 and 25,000 tonnes.\"It was practically empty,\" the official said, adding that the building had suffered a \"total loss.\" He declined to comment on the dollar amount of the damage.The official, who wished to remain anonymous, said the fire had not damaged any of the surrounding grain elevators.\"Our grain elevators are intact.

{"token": "The investigation of TWA Flight 800's crash is racking up monumental costs, which has forced the cash-strapped U.S. National Transportation Safety Board to seek help from the corporations involved.The investigation off the coast of Long Island, N.Y. is costing well over $100,000 a day - about $3 million so far - according to a spokesman at the NTSB.The NTSB sent letters last week to Trans World Airlines Inc, Boeing Co, makers of the downed 747 jetliner, and United Technologies Corp's Pratt & Whitney Canada Inc unit, which made the jet's engines.  TWA was asked for $5 million, Boeing was asked for $2 million, and Pratt & Whitney was asked for $1 million, the NTSB spokesman said.All three companies confirmed through spokesmen receipt of the letters and the amounts requested, and all three said the request was being considered.\"It's not unusual, in major investigations when costs go well above what's normal, for the Board to request payments from parties involved in the investigation or others involved in the investigation,\" the NTSB spokesman said.  \"We did that because there were some extraordinary costs that the Board couldn't absorb.\"The majority of the expense is for the hiring of private salvage boats and other contractors. The tab also includes about $5,000 a day to rent the hangar where the wreckage is being reassembled, and thousands in ancillary expenses, such as hotel, transportation, food and phone bills for an army of investigators, the agency said.  The safety board's annual budget is about $37.5 million, but extraordinary costs for investigations come from a special fund of $1 million authorized by Congress. When that $1 million is exhausted, the NTSB must go back before Congress seeking replenishment, the spokesman said.The fund has \"several hundred thousand dollars\" remaining, but, after the investigations of ValuJet's crash in the Florida Everglades in May and Germany's Birgenair crash in the Dominican Republic in February, the fund will need a cash infusion soon, he said.  The Flight 800 investigation is exceptionally costly because it is taking place 10 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean and 120 feet deep.By contrast, the investigation of the USAir's September 1994 crash outside of Pittsburgh, Pa. - although it is still ongoing two years later - has amounted to only about $1 million because it was all on dry land.The Birgenair accident was a watery crash, but most of the investigation was satisfied by information on the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. But the cost still amounted to about $800,000, the NTSB spokesman said.  TWA spokesman John McDonald said the carrier has already spent in excess of $1 million on accomodations at John F. Kennedy International Airport for the families of the crash victims.Suffolk County's budget director, Kenneth Weiss, said the county's cost so far adds up to $4.4 million. Of that amount, about $1.6 million came from overtime wages and $1.3 million in regular salaries.DNA testing equipment was purchased by the county at a cost of $181,000 and a helicopter landing pad was enlarged at a cost of $60,000, Weiss said.The county's 1996 budget totals $1.6 billion, he said.\"My understanding is that the local government cost will be reimbursed by the federal or state government. There may be a problem with the federal cost, but that's not our concern,\" Weiss said.  All 230 passengers died when the Boeing 747 exploded and plunged into the ocean on July 17.Although the cause of the crash has not been officially determined, divers have recently discovered wreckage with traces of two types of chemicals used in explosives.", "label": ["C13", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GDIS", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

His second and final term as president of Serbia expires in 1997 and he is widely expected to run for the Yugoslav presidency next year.The authorities hope November elections would provide Milosevic with a clear majority in the federal parliament.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Predictions made just a decade ago that the beginning of the end of oil production from the North Sea would be seen by now have missed their mark.Not content with defying even the most optimistic production forecasts, North Sea oil and gas executives gaze into a crystal ball this week to find ways to continue to stave off challenges facing one of the world's most important commodities.With combined oil and gas production from North Sea producers Norway, Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark at record highs and oil prices more than $4 a barrel over 1995 levels, delegates will be in good humour at the open on Tuesday of the biannual Offshore Northern Sea (ONS) conference in the west coast Norway oil centre Stavanger.The four-day conference, focusing on global energy strategies into the next century, will bring together some 30,000 oil company executives, contractors, suppliers and government officials. About 1,000 exhibitors from 25 nations will show their wares in the North Sea's premier oil convention.Heading the speakers' list are Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and Energy Minister Jens Stoltenberg of host Norway, the North Sea's largest oil producer.Norway's interest in oil's future is particularly strong since it faces a downturn in production in just a few years if current forecasts can be believed.The Scandinavian nation, which pumps around 3.2 million barrels per day of oil, is the world's second largest exporter after Saudi Arabia. It will also be in the top five gas suppliers to continental Europe when it opens the taps on the huge Troll gas field in October.Faced with low oil prices and ever-increasing competition from low-cost producers in the Mideast, North Sea oil companies developed innovative drilling and 3-D seismic techniques and employed severe cost-cutting measures enabling them to pump more oil and at much lower costs than expected.Despite the North Sea's good fortunes, the importance of such oil industry gatherings is greater than ever, says Knut Aam, chairman of the conference committee and senior vice- president for exploration and production at Phillips Petroleum Co, USA.\"This year's programme deals with future challenges rather than looking back at past accomplishments. We have plenty of challenges facing us and good cooperation between all parties will lead to good solutions to meet these challenges,\" he saidThe conference will tackle global competition and the need to raise revenues as opportunities to reduce costs become more limited.The changing face of the European gas market, political and technical issues surrounding hydrocarbon transportation and technology challenges of deep water developments will also be on the agenda.", "label": ["C15", "C152", "C21", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

As infrastructure demand continues to rise in Asia, so would its need for raw materials that could be provided by Latin American exporters.High-level government visits between the regions had increased over the past few months, diplomats said, a sign of the growing importance of Asian-Latin American links.Argentine president Carlos Menem just completed a visit to Malaysia and Indonesia during which he called for improved trade links between the seven-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the South American common market, Mercosur.Mercosur comprises Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, with Chile as an associate member.Thailand was already Southeast Asia's biggest importer from Brazil, said Ambassador Arnaldo Carrilho.\"Last year, the value of our merchandise exports (FOB) to the Thai market amounted to $419 million, one quarter of the total exported to the six other ASEAN nations,\" he said.Amnuay said it was time for Thailand to branch out from its traditional economic partners in Asia, Europe and North America.\"With continued efforts at economic integration within and between the two regions, I believe Asia and Latin America will carry great weight in international economic affairs,\" he said.\"We should, therefore, take advantage of this opportunity to expand our trade and investment cooperation, and bridge the gaps which have too long separated us,\" Amnuay said.", "label": ["E51", "E512", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Eleven people, including a television cameraman whose filming angered military police, were seriously injured on Thursday in a fresh clash between security forces and peasant protesters in Colombia's southern Caqueta province, authorities said.The latest clash, in which most of the injured were wounded by gunshot wounds, came amid a growing controversy in Bogota over curbs on television coverage of the protests, which have rocked Caqueta and two other southern provinces since last month.Under a resolution announced last Friday -- when at least four protesters were killed in Caqueta -- the state-run National Television Commission banned all TV reports about the protests based on anything but official sources. It also barred TV news programmes from showing any images related to the protests \"that reflect situations of extreme human suffering.\"Dramatic images of troops clubbing a protester in a rain- soaked field were nonetheless broadcast over Colombian television on Thursday evening.The footage was taken by camerman Luis Gonzalo Velez of the 12:30 news programme, who kept his camera running as rifle-wielding MPs then came racing down a roadway on foot, hurling insults at him and demanding that he hand over the video cassette he had just filmed.The footage stops with the sound of a crash as the camera drops suddenly to one side. Velez was flown to a Bogota hospital on Thursday evening with multiple trauma injuries that Hans Sarmiento, a 12:30 producer who covered Thursday's melee along with Velez, said were inflicted by at least one soldier beating him with the butt of his rifle.Witnesses said Thursday's clash occurred when thousands of peasants, barred from entering Caqueta's provincial capital of Florencia but virtually washed out of makeshift camps by heavy rains overnight, surged toward a military barricade on a bridge leading into the city. Troops opened fire with tear gas and live ammunition to halt the drive across the bridge, the witnesses, including Sarmineto, said.A report from Florencia's Maria Inmaculada hospital said 11 people with serious injuries were taken there after protesters retreated from the bridge -- including a 19-year-old man shot in his right eye.Hundreds of thousands of peasants have staged mass protests in Caqueta and neighbouring Putumayo and Guaviare provinces since last month against the government's U.S.-backed drug crop eradication programme.At least 12 peasant growers of coca leaf -- the raw material for cocaine -- have been killed in the protests so far as they pressed demands for more government aid for crop substitution and for the eradication of grinding levels of poverty in Colombia's jungle-covered south.", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Kazakhstan aims to earn over two billion dollars in taxes and royalties over the next 20 years from its Kumkol oil field, sold to Canada's Hurricane Hydrocarbons Ltd on Wednesday, a senior Kazakh official said.Saribay Kalmurzayev, chairman of Kazakhstan's State Property Committee, told journalists at the signing of a share purchase agreement in the capital Almaty on Wednesday: \"There should be no idea that we sold it (Kumkol) cheap.\"  Kalmurzayev said Kazakhstan would earn $530 million in royalties and $1.7 billion in tax revenues from the deal over the next 20 years.Hurricane gained 90 percent of shares with one hundred percent of the voting rights in Yuzhneftegaz, of which the Kumkol field is part, by undertaking to invest $280 million in Yuzhneftegaz over the next six years and paying off the enterprise's debts.The field is located in the south of the vast Central Asian nation. The remaining 10 percent of preferential shares are held by Yuzhneftegaz's 1,500-strong workforce.  The deal had earlier floundered on disagreements over the enterprise's debts, which Kalmurzayev estimates at $105 million. The issue is to finalised in November.Hurricane's president, John Komarnicki, said his company planned to boost oil production from 50,000 bpd to 70,000 bpd in the next 4-5 years. He said Hurricane planned to extract a total of 500 million barrels of oil from the Kumkol field.There remained some uncertainty over the status of existing joint ventures between Yuzhneftegaz and other companies currently extracting crude from Kumkol.  Yuzhneftegaz and Russian oil giant Lukoil already have a joint venture, each with 50 percent, to work a northern section of the Kumkol field.Lukoil appears to remain in place but Hurricane's Komarnicki said he planned to negotiate with Lukoil a \"more efficient\" use of the field.Komarnicki said production would be aimed at the local market but did not rule out eventual exports south through Iran.Kalmurzayev said the deadline to sell off the oil-rich republic's Pavlodar, Atyrau, Mangestau and Uzein oil refineries had been extended to September 15.--Almaty newsroom +3272 509410", "label": ["C181", "C18", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "A U.S. District Court judge in Cleveland on Wednesday ordered that a 13.5 property tax mill operating levy be placed on the November ballot for the Cleveland schools.The judge's order came after the Ohio Department of Education, which took control of the schools in March 1995, filed a motion asking the court to override the Cleveland School Board's decision Monday rejecting a referendum to increase the levy.In his order, Judge George W. White ordered the state superintendent of schools to certify the levy request with the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections before Thursday's deadline for inclusion on the November ballot.Steve Puckett, an assistant state superintendent of education, said the levy was needed to improve services at the schools and to start paying off the district's operating debt.According to Bryan Christman, the schools interim chief financial officer and treasurer, the district has about $87 million of operating debt that is due to mature in December and next June.In addition, the school system also faces a a $23 million deficit in its $500 million general fund budget, he added.Christman said the levy would raise about $67.5 million a year.Puckett said the state pushed for the levy request because it was Cleveland's turn to start supporting its schools.\"The state's position is the community needs to come to the plate and supply local revenues,\" he said, adding that the last levy passed for the Cleveland schools was in 1983.Puckett said without the levy increase, the school system would face a budget gap of $150 million next year. He added the levy request was supported by the state and the plaintiffs in an ongoing federal desegregation case involving the Cleveland schools.A 1994 consent decree provided for the placement of an operating levy before voters each year, unless all parties -- the state, the district and the plaintiffs -- agreed that such a move would be counterproductive.Meanwhile, the Cleveland school face the possibility of a teachers' strike shortly after school starts on Aug. 28, Christman said.--Karen Pierog, 312-408-8647", "label": ["E211", "E21", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The industry ministry, which prepared the regulation published in the Official Gazette, sided with the ITB in the dispute.But shortly after news of the regulation, which takes effect immediately, the head of the SPK said in a statement that the board would appeal to the supreme court to have the regulation cancelled.\"The right to prepare legislation and regulation on such markets lies with the Capital Markets Board according to the laws,\" Ali Ihsan said.\"Our priority in the country is not to set up trade bourses but maintain confidence in markets and take measures to boost stability, reduce risks and protect investors.\"Ozmen, who played down the SPK's opposition, said the board would eventually be persuaded and would give its consent.\"The exchange is a new concept for Turkey and that's why we have different views at initial stages.

The amount will be raised up to 10 billion from 2005.Murathan said design of the new pipeline from Russia would be completed by the end of this year and construction work would begin in 1997.He said Turkey would receive a total 9.2 billion cubic metres of gas this year, up 2.4 billion from last year, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports equivalent to a total of 2.48 billion cubic metres.He said the loop and compressor system on the existing Russian line would help meet gas demand from domestic users.Expansion work at an LNG terminal in western Turkey has recently been put up for tender and this would add a 4.5 billion cubic metres to supply in 1997, he said.He said Botas was considering another LNG terminal, but did not elaborate on the project.He also added that Botas had agreed with state Turkish Petroleum (TPAO) to have it build an underground gas storage in western Marmara region with a capacity of 2.5 billion cubic metres to help smooth out fluctuations during periods of peak demand from domestic gas consumers.", "label": ["C24", "C33", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Vietnam is expected to place two prominent intellectuals on trial this week nine months after the pair were arrested in a crackdown on dissent ahead of June's Communist Party Congress.Dissident sources and Hanoi-based diplomats said Le Hong Ha, a former high-ranking party member, and Ha Si Phu, a leading academic, would appear in court in Hanoi on Thursday.The two men are being charged under a catch-all section of Vietnam's penal code involving violations of national security. If convicted they face likely jail terms of between two and seven years. In serious cases the term can be extended to 15 years.Their arrests late last year were widely interpreted as part of a broader crackdown on dissent as the Hanoi authorities prepared for the June congress.Ha Si Phu, also known as Nguyen Xuan Tu, was detained following an interview with a foreign radio station and after distributing documents in which it is said he openly criticised the Hanoi government.Le Hong Ha, whose also used the name Le Van Quy, was expelled from the ruling Communist Party in June last year after voicing support for an outspoken communist dissident Hoang Minh Chinh. Hoang Minh Chinh had been jailed a few weeks earlier.Several international human rights groups condemned the arrests at the time.The U.S.-based group Human Rights Watch/Asia said Vietnam -- which signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1982 -- had placed itself in violation of international laws.Official confirmation was not available on Tuesday and it was not clear whether outside observers would be allowed to attend the trial.But foreign diplomats said the trial -- the first such case since the congress -- was likely to be watched for indications of the prevailing political mood in Vietnam.The late-June conclave, the country's most important political event in years, saw a shake-up of the party leadership and the appointment of a number of security and defence-related personnel to prominent politburo positions.But seven weeks after that event the picture remains hazy, and Hanoi's political rumour mill has fallen quiet. In some cases newly-appointed personnel have yet to take up their expected posts.In a faxed statement the Paris-based pressure group Alliance Vietnam Liberte said Ha Si Phu's case was being followed closely by groups across Europe and North America.It called on Hanoi to allow independent observers to attend the trial.

Khan told Reuters. \"Some documents were seized and are being scrutinised.\" The Press Trust of India (PTI) said his offices were also raided on Friday.Neither Nahata nor company officials could be reached for comment. \"Some CBI officials did visit the house of Mr Nahata and held discussions with him,\" PTI quoted a senior company official, Arvind Kharbanda, as saying.Last week, the CBI seized cash worth over $1 million from two homes belonging to Sukh Ram. He was abroad during the raids last week and was located on Friday in London.His relatives told the Indian high commission in London he was unwell and planned to return to India within a week, PTI said. He was earlier in the United States as part of a trip which media reports said was for treatment linked to heart problems.Khan confirmed police searches of Nahata's home were linked to last week's corruption case against Sukh Ram.Former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's Congress party, defeated in April-May general elections this year, suspended Sukh Ram from its membership this week after the raids.No formal charges have been laid by the CBI but a senior telephone department official has been arrested in the case. On Friday, police arrested the owner of a radio equipment firm alleged to have been favoured by Sukh Ram, PTI said.Sukh Ram oversaw a yet-unfinished privatisation process that began in 1994 and was accused by the opposition of unfairly favouring the HFCL in an auction of licences under an economic reform programme started in 1991. He has denied the accusations.Although the raids on his homes were not linked to the privatisation of telephone services, they revived simmering charges that Sukh Ram mishandled the tendering process for licences in the privatisation scheme.Opposition parties protesting against Sukh Ram and the licensing process virtually paralysed parliament during a month-long session last December.On Monday, new Communications Minister Beni Prasad Verma ordered an overhaul of the committee which awards the licences.", "label": ["C12", "C13", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "South Africa's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country's race war on their hands.Leaders of the major parties involved, from right-wing whites to radical blacks, appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid.Most, including former president F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers.But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating.Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission, the amnesty committee.\"I don't think one should have expected more than what one got,\" he said. \"That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all.\"The commission, which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses, has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds.But others, such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader Dirk Coetzee, have yet to testify.Tutu's deputy chairman, Alex Boraine, told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week. He added that former hardline apartheid president P.W. Botha could be among those called.But Currin, who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators, said this was not the best way to achieve the commission's aims.\"A person can be forced to appear, but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee. At the moment this is not the case.\"He cited Coetzee, who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks. His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that.Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission.Last week's submissions to the commission by the ANC, de Klerk's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied.Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled, separate submission, but one black caller to a radio talk show declared:\"This whole thing is utterly useless, it doesn't help us at all. What the people expect is to have houses, to have jobs.\"Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party, which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990, felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission.\"Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation. One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary,\" he said.Professor Tom Lodge of the University of the Witwatersrand demurred, saying:\"In the irritation, in the jokes, in the anger that white South Africans express about the commission, I think there's a moral uneasiness, and I think that's healthy. Responsibility is percolating downwards.\"", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

We believe the public protector should once again open the investigation to reveal the truth once and for all.\"The National Party of former president F.W. de Klerk, now in opposition after quitting the government of national unity in June, issued a statement saying parliament should launch an investigation.The row erupted earlier this year when it emerged that Zuma had approved a 14 million rand ($3.1 million) subsidy, using European Union aid, for a Broadway-style musical \"Sarafina II\" intended to encourage safe sex.When opposition parties objected that this was a waste of scarce resources, the public protector began an investigation that reported in June that Zuma, among other things, had misled parliament.At the time Zuma rejected opposition demands that she resign but announced that support for the play would be withdrawn and the EU, whose money had been used without its knowledge, would get its aid back.She said a private donor who refused to be publicly identified had pledged to contribute about 10 million rand to cover the government's contractual obligations.But newspapers reported at the weekend that the donor had yet to pay the money.Mandela, who has repeatedly defended Zuma, said on Monday she was a very good minister and her critics should resolve their problems by sitting down to talk to her.\"That's laughable,\" Ellis said, adding that the last time a parliamentary committee quizzed Zuma over Sarafina she had been arrogant, aggressive and dishonest.\"One has to question if there ever was a private sponsor and why that person would want to remain anonymous,\" Ellis said. \"One has to start to question what that person would want in return.\"  ($1 = R4.52)", "label": ["E51", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GHEA", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Boeing Co. is expected to use the biennial Farnborough Air Show in England next week to formally launch the long-awaited stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet, industry analysts say.While officials of the aerospace giant remain tight-lipped, analysts say it is all but certain executives will make a major announcement on Monday regarding two new members of the 747 family that will be known as the 747-500 and 747-600.\"They're going to announce the airplanes -- there is no doubt,\" said Joe Campbell, an analyst at Lehman Bros.He said the only question was whether Boeing would announce massive orders of $10 billion or more from launch customers or merely disclose that its board of directors had given authorisation to offer the jet.The announcement of the new models, which would include a jet with 30 percent more capacity than today's largest commercial airliner, is expected to be the highlight of the air show, frequently the stage for major order announcements and other industry news.Boeing officials have said they are talking with at least six airlines about the potential new versions of the jumbo jet, including British Airways Plc, Singapore Airlines Ltd. and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.Boeing President Phil Condit said the company's board of directors discussed the new plane at a regularly scheduled meeting Monday but had not made a decision on whether to launch it.\"That will depend on airline orders,\" he said in a brief interview Tuesday.Specifications being circulated within the industry call for the 747-600 to hold 548 passengers in a typical three-class configuration with a range of up to 8,900 miles (14,300 km), compared with 416 passengers and 8,400 miles (13,500 km) for the current-generation 747-400.The long-range 747-500 would hold 462 passengers in three classes and have a range of up to 10,000 miles (16,000 km).Analysts say the 747 stretch is essential for Boeing to continue dominating the lucrative top end of the market -- which it has had to itself since the introduction of the four-engine jumbo jet in 1970, which nearly bankrupted the company.Now Boeing's own new 777 twin-engine jet is replacing older 747s, and possible new versions of jets from rivals Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp. could threaten the lower end of the jumbo market.\"They really do need to be able to move up to again have a position of complete monopoly for the aircraft as they have had for a number of years,\" said analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.Meanwhile Airbus has signalled that it intends to go ahead with plans for its own all-new 550-seat plane, dubbed the 3XX, although analysts question whether the market for jumbo jets is big enough for two manufacturers.\"From an economic point of view, I don't think there's enough demand to justify the $10 (billion) to $15 billion cost\" of an all-new jet, said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities.He and other analysts said they expect air travel in the fast-growing Pacific region to follow the Atlantic in migrating to pairs of smaller cities rather than routes between world capitals that require the largest jets.The trend toward such more thinly travelled routes was among the reasons cited by Boeing when it shelved a project to jointly develop with Airbus a double-decker airliner that would hold up to 800 passengers.But Lehman's Campbell predicted Europe's Airbus, which is transforming itself from a consortium into a single company, would go ahead with its own jumbo jet for commercial delivery in 2003, about three years after Boeing's new 747 models.\"They're not going to leave Boeing alone at the upper end,\" he said.Campbell estimated that Boeing's 747 revision, which would include a new wing, new engines and possible new cockpit electronics, would cost from $5 billion to $8 billion to develop.Rolls-Royce Plc has said it plans to offer a variant of its Trent turbofan engine to power the new Boeing craft, while rivals General Electric Co. and United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney unit have formed a joint venture to develop an alternative power plant.", "label": ["C22", "C32", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "A Paris court on Monday barred the expulsion of three African immigrants who staged a 52-day hunger strike for the right to stay in France as immigrant leaders said they hoped their cause would become a national movement.Riot police ringed the administrative court as it considered appeals against expulsion orders for some 80 of the 210 immigrants forcibly ejected on Friday from a Paris church that they had occupied in protest at tough French immigration laws.Lawyer Anne Bremaud said the court ruled that the three men -- among a total of 10 Africans who had staged the hunger strike -- could not be deported in view of their health.Police said that only one of the 10 would qualify for residence, but the government has said it would not expel anyone who was seriously ill.The 10 hunger strikers, most of them from Mali, called off their fast on Sunday after police released them.\"They have started taking mashed food as they are unable to eat any solid food. They are very tired,\" said their spokesman, Doro Traore.Supporters of the Africans' cause have scheduled a major demonstration in Paris on Wednesday.The Africans themselves are now calling for a second protest on September 18 in front of the headquarters of the Council of Europe in the eastern French city of Strasbourg.\"We have the French people's support,\" said Ababakar Diop, who had acted as a spokesman for the protesting Africans when they were occupying the Saint-Bernard church in the capital's multi-ethnic Goutte d'Or district.\"Much of French public opinion is today favourable to our cause. We say that this is a victory,\" added Madjiguene Cisse, a spokeswoman for the Africans.An IPSOS opinion poll for the daily Le Monde showed voters evenly divided in their views of the government's policy of strictly enforcing immigration laws while reviewing each protester's case on an individual basis on humanitarian grounds.But 46 percent said they sympathised with the protesting immigrants while 36 percent were hostile, according to the poll.Most of the protesters were resting after moving their headquarters to a disused ammunition factory in the eastern Vincennes suburb. Some were enjoying the sunshine in the Vincennes park after weeks holed up in the Saint-Bernard church.Lawyers managed to get most protesters released at the weekend in a legal battle to keep them in the country, prompting some media to accuse the government of confusion. \"The Great Muddle,\" the left-wing daily Liberation said in a headline of the confusion about the legality of expulsion orders.Traore said all but 15 of the protesters were free and in the care of human rights groups.Four were deported to Senegal, Mali and Zaire on a French military plane at the weekend.

{"token": "Susan McDougal, a former business partner and close friend of President Bill Clinton, was sentenced on Tuesday to two years in prison for her fraud convictions in a Whitewater trial.U.S. District Judge George Howard gave McDougal three concurrent two-year prison terms and an additional three years probation. She was convicted in May on four charges relating to a fraudulent $300,000 business loan awarded to her in 1986.Prosecutors alleged Clinton twice pressured an Arkansas banker to give McDougal the loan and that part of the funds went to benefit the failed Whitewater real estate venture in which Clinton and his wife invested, and lost, money.But the president, who was Arkansas governor at the time of the deal, was not charged with any crime and he flatly denied under oath any involvement in the affair.Defence attorney Bobby McDaniel angrily alleged on Tuesday that McDougal, 41, was the victim of a partisan investigation aimed at humiliating Clinton in an election year. \"She is a pawn of a political agenda. If Bill Clinton had not been nominated, none of this would ever have occurred,\" he said.McDaniel told reporters the team of independent counsel Kenneth Starr had offered McDougal leniency in exchange for information implicating the president or first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in any illegal deals.Starr, who is leading the Whitewater probe into the Clintons' finances, refused to comment on whether he would try to cut a deal with McDougal but he did say his team wanted to get to the bottom of the case. \"Our investiation is to get at the facts, get at the truth and we would obviously welcome any person willing to assist us in that endeavour,\" he said.Susan McDougal, her former husband James McDougal and the Clintons were partners in the Whitewater venture and were close friends throughout the 1980s.James McDougal, 56, was convicted on 18 fraud and conspiracy charges and faced up to 84 years in prison but his sentencing has been postponed until November because he is cooperating with Starr's team.A colourful Arkansas businessman and political insider, he backed Clinton's rise through the political ranks and knows the president better than anyone else so far targeted in the Whitewater probe. It was not clear what information he may be able to give Starr on Clinton, but prosecutors were expected to focus on Clinton's alleged involvement in winning the $300,000 loan that was taken out in Susan McDougal's name.Starr has said his politically sensitive investigation will be put on ice before the Nov. 5 election but refused to put a date on it. He said on Monday the probe was still \"moving forward very rapidly\" on several fronts.Susan McDougal's lawyers on Tuesday portrayed her as a naive young woman at the time of the offences, saying she unthinkingly followed the instructions of her husband, who is 15 years her senior. \"He was always my teacher and my mentor ... everything Jim had done always seemed right to me,\" Susan McDougal said in pleading for leniency. \"I am truly sorry.\"But Judge Howard was not swayed. \"The court is persuaded it will take Mrs. McDougal out of circulation for a reasonable period of time and afford her the opportunity to do some reflective thinking,\" he said.Apart from the prison sentence, Susan McDougal was told to pay restitution of $300,000 plus interest to the U.S. Small Business Adminstration, which had insured the illegal loan. Howard also ordered her to pay a $5,000 fine and do more than 300 hours of community service.Former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, who was not a partner in the Whitewater deal but was convicted with the McDougals on fraud and conspiracy charges, was sentenced on Monday to four years probation and fines of more than $300,000.Tucker, who resigned his office in July, avoided jail time because of a life-threatening liver problem that physicians said had a 50 percent chance of killing him within two years if he did not get a liver transplant.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The unit will comprise professionals who will be assisted by a value for money auditor,\" Etete said.  In a move to increase local participation in the industry Etete said that oil industry contracts should be handed only to Nigerian-registered companies.He also said expatriate staff should not be engaged by joint venture companies without the approval of the National Petroleum Investment Management services, the company which oversees the government's interest in the joint ventures.\"Partly due to (employing expatraites unnecessarily) the average unit production cost for Nigerian fields has, over the years, been progressively on the rise whereas the trend has been the opposite in other producing companies,\" he said.  Nigeria pumps around two million barrels of crude oil a day in joint venture agreements between state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and foreign multinationals.The companies have previously presented bills to the government for the costs of production and exploration based on the amount they say they have spent.Etete said marginal fields within the concession area of the major companies, but left unexploited would be handed out to companies that are interested in exploiting them.\"These measures are not new, and not unusual in the industry. the focus is to ensure that the existing laws, which are not different from what obtains elsewhere in the world are fully enforced,\" Etete said.--Lagos newsroom +234 1 2630317", "label": ["C11", "C13", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "South Korea, hampered by slowing exports and sluggish capital investments, announced gloomy second-quarter economic growth on Tuesday, prompting economists to urge the tackling of high costs and low efficiency.The central Bank of Korea (BOK) said gross domestic product (GDP) grew a real 6.7 percent in the second quarter of this year, against 9.7 percent a year earlier.Sceptical stock investors dumped shares, sending the market index tumbling to a new 33-month low. The composite stock index closed 5.14 points lower at 761.75 on Tuesday. It was the lowest close since November 3, 1993, when the index ended at 756.87.There was widespread pessimism over the government's ability to ease the economy down gently after last year's breakneck expansion, brokers said.The BOK revised down its forecast for 1996 gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 7.0 percent from an earlier projected 7.2 percent. The GDP, the total value of goods and services produced by an economy excluding income from abroad, grew 9.0 percent last year.\"A slowdown in exports combined with stagnant capital investments have been major factors impeding economic growth,\" said Rhee Namuh, head of research of Dongbang Peregrine. \"The seven percent growth forecast still looks high.\"The nation's exports have been hit by falling prices for key money-earners including semiconductors, petrochemicals and steel, which represent nearly 40 percent of total exports.A central bank official said the unit price for the 16-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips dropped about 70 percent in June from a year earlier when it was $45-$50.Recently, the yen's fall against the U.S. dollar eroded price competitiveness of South Korean products in the world market. Last year, the yen was strong and contributed to Korea's brisk overseas shipments.\"But we don't need to be alarmed with the second-quarter figures as last year's growth was extremely fast,\" Rhee said.This year's second-quarter exports rose 14.1 percent year-on-year, compared with 24.9 percent a year before.\"It's still a high growth rate. I'm not concerned about the exports in the second quarter,\" said Paeng Dong-joong, director of the central bank's statistics division.With most large production expansion projects completed last year, capital investment in the second quarter slowed to 3.4 percent against 18.0 percent a year earlier.\"Many domestic companies tended to avoid further investment at home due to high wages, financing costs and too many administrative regulations,\" said Lee Han-ku, president of Daewoo Economic and Research Institute.Economists blamed recent wage hikes, soaring financing and distribution costs and expensive land prices for dulling South Korean firms' competitive edge in the global market.These problems did not surface previously because the strong yen masked many of the economy's underlying faults. It would take some time before the issues were resolved, they said.\"The economic difficulties we face now were caused by the problem of high costs, including wages, over the past 10 years. It can't be solved overnight,\" Kim Young-dae, the central bank's assistant governor, told reporters.Wage rises in manufacturing averaged 10.4 percent between 1987 and 1994.

Saks would acquire the other three, one in Dallas and two in Houston.The deal does not signal a decision by Dayton Hudson to sell off its department stores, which have suffered years of stagnant sales and flat or declining profits, the company said.\"We remain committed to the department store division,\" company Chairman Bob Ulrich said in a statement.\"The sale of our four Texas Marshall Field's stores allows the department store division to focus its resources in its core Midwest markets where we have a strong presence,\" he said.Except for the four Texas sites, the company's department store division -- including Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field's outlets -- are all located in the upper Midwest.Dayton Hudson also is parent of Target, the discount store chain, and Mervyn's, a mid-level department store.\"This signals a retrenchment to a more familiar and somewhat less competitive market,\" said analyst Saul Yaari of Piper Jaffray Inc. \"It just didn't make sense to operate down there (in Texas).\"The four stores in Texas had $120 million in revenue and were profitable, Dayton Hudson said. Dayton Hudson acquired the four stores when it bought Marshall Field's from Batus Inc., a unit of BAT Industries Inc., in 1990.Since the acquisition, shoppers have complained that Dayton Hudson tarnished Marshall Field's image. They said the chain was run more like a discount store than an exclusive department store.During the last year, Dayton Hudson launched a restructuring of its department stores that included $20 million in cost cuts. It is trying to elevate the chain's image by carrying pricier merchandise, scaling back clearance sales and beefing up customer service.Last year, profit at the department stores fell to $184 million from $270 million a year earlier. Revenues were flat at about $3.2 billion.Earlier this month, Dayton Hudson said its earnings rose to $101 million, or $0.42 a share, in the second quarter, from $28.0 million, or $0.11 a share, a year earlier.

{"token": "Troubled insurance market Lloyd's of London said on Tuesday that over 82 percent of its worldwide membership had accepted the terms of its 3.2 billion pound ($4.99 billion) rescue plan ahead of Wednesday's crucial deadline.The announcement came as the market awaited a U.S. appeals court decision due at 1800 GMT which threatens to throw the recovery plan off track, by giving American investors more time to think over the settlement offer.It also emerged on Tuesday that New York regulators may freeze the insurance market's assets if Britain declares the market insolvent.With just one day to go until the deadline for its 34,000 investors worldwide -- called Names -- to accept or reject the proposals, Lloyd's is hoping that the support shown by Names will be enough to declare the plan unconditional when its ruling council meets on Thursday.\"I am encouraged by the steady flow of acceptances we have received since midday on Saturday. At that time 75 percent of our members had accepted,\" Lloyd's chairman David Rowland said in a statement.\"I am confident that the acceptance level will have increased yet again by the time our deadline is reached at non tomorrow (1100 GMT),\" Rowland added.But an injunction granted by a judge in Virginia late on Friday granting all 2,700 U.S. Names extra time to consider the plan, under which they would help pay to reinsure billions of pounds of liabilities into a new company called Equitas, means success is less than certain.New York's insurance regulator said it would move to seize Lloyd's U.S. trust fund assets only if Britain's Department of Trade and Industry declares Lloyd's insolvent.If the British regulator decides Lloyd's is insolvent and that the reorganisation plan will work, New York will not need to take action, a spokesman for the insurance department told Reuters in New York.A Lloyd's spokesman declined to comment on whether the funds might be frozen. He said the insurance market was in constant contact with the New York Insurance Department and was keeping it fully informed of developments.On Monday, its lawyers were preparing for the appeal in Baltimore, Maryland, which could run to Wednesday. The acceptance deadline passes at noon London time (1100 GMT) on Wednesday and Lloyd's will know shortly afterwards if it has enough \"yes\" votes to declare the recovery plan unconditional.The insurance market's leaders have constantly emphasised that the August 28 settlement deadline is immutable, because Lloyd's must shortly afterwards pass annual solvency tests both in Britain and the United States.Rowland is hoping support for the plan will swell to the critical mass of settling litigants and major debtors needed to push it through.But some form of limited extension should not necessarily be ruled out.The number of U.S. Names electing to wait while the judge's order remains in force is likely to be a key factor in whether Lloyd's can implement the recovery proposals as planned.Under the terms of the injunction, which Lloyd's hopes to overthrow, U.S. Names are not barred from accepting the plan.But Payne has said Lloyd's should provide them with more information by September 23. They have until September 30 to pay funds into an escrow account, after which there remains another month in which to accede finally or not.Even if the insurance market does succeed in overturning the judge's order, further litigation is still a possibility.A top legal official in Colorado, which signed an agreement along with 37 other U.S. states in July ending action against Lloyd's in return for extra financial assistance for U.S. Names, said last week that it was working on a new claim.

One bomb exploded overnight on Wednesday and another was defused.The Interior Ministry said police had \"identified the group of commandos which is very probably responsible for the (latest two) attacks\". It said six people were being held in custody by police in Ajaccio.\"Handguns, ammunition, bullet-proof vests, hoods, scanners and detonator fuses identical to those used in previous attacks were found in searches in the homes of those held,\" the ministry said in a statement.Earlier, police sources had said seven people were detained, all of them suspected members or sympathisers of the Cuncolta Naziunalista nationalist group. Three of them were suspected of direct responsibility for bombings in recent days.Overnight on Wednesday, a two kg (four lb) bomb seriously damaged two floors of Agriculture Ministry offices located just 50 metres (yards) from a police station in the centre of the island capital Ajaccio. No one was hurt.A second device, packed with five kg (10 lbs) of explosive, was defused before it could go off, police said.Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups, told the daily La Corse in a statement he had given \"firm orders\" to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice.Judges on the island had accused Paris of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists, which have now failed.The latest bombing, on the heels of the new orders, had brought charges that police were powerless.\"No searches, no arrests, no police reinforcements visible on the island, despite the ministry's promises,\" the daily France-Soir lamented before news of the arrests.\"It is time to end this nightly farce,\" said the pro-government daily Le Figaro in an editorial.Corsica has been racked by low-level separatist-inspired violence, mainly against government targets, for two decades.

{"token": "Speculation about the ownership of life insurer Lloyds Abbey Life Plc ignited its share price on Wednesday as dealers reckoned it might be takeover fodder for cash-rich insurance giant Prudential Corp Plc.Analysts said a more likely scenario was that British banking group Lloyds TSB Group Plc wanted to increase its 62 percent stake in the life insurer.All three companies said they did not comment on market rumours, while Lloyds Abbey Life's share price traded 31 pence higher (Corrects from \"traded 30.5 percent higher\") at 591.5 pence, just off the 607p day's high.Since Lloyds' merger with TSB last December the future of Lloyds Abbey Life has hung in the balance as Lloyds acquired TSB's life assurance operation as a result of the merger.Analysts said this raised the possibility of merging the two operations.\"We're waiting for an announcement,\" one analyst said, referring to continuing internal discussions about Lloyds Abbey Life's strategic options under a steering group run by chief executive Stephen Maran.Analysts said the options being considered were varied, and ranged from doing nothing to closing down altogether.Maran declined to take calls from Reuters on Wednesday and a company official would only say that the company did not comment on market rumours. But at the time of its interim results in July finance director Laurel Powers-Freeling told Reuters the talks had not been concluded.\"There is a range of options, there a number of permutations,\" Powers-Freeling said then.ABN Amro Hoare Govett analyst John Russell said Lloyds Abbey Life was unlikely bid target for Prudential, on the look-out for a life insurer or building society and swilling with cash after selling its reinsurance arm Mercantile and General back to Swiss Re on Tuesday for 1.75 billion pounds.\"Prudential is more likely to demutualise a mutual and get access to IFAs,\" said Russell.Analysts said a more likely fate for Lloyds Abbey Life was that Lloyds TSB will pick up the remaining stake or do a deal with the minority holders to give back Abbey Life and personal loans finance arm Bowmaker.\"They may unravel it...and give Abbey Life back to minority shareholders,\" said Russell.Among the minority shareholders is PDFM, the fund management arm of UBS, analysts said.But analysts also noted comments by Lloyds TSB chief executive Sir Brian Pitman in June when he said the bank had no plans to increase its take in the insurer.They also said Lloyds Abbey Life's shares could be adjusting to more realistic levels after the insurers' first-half profits showed a 28 percent rise to 259.2 million pounds last month.Both the unnamed analyst and ABN Amro Hoare Govett's Russell said they had increased their valuation of the shares to 600 pence after its interim results, a level to which they rose on Wednesday.", "label": ["C15", "C152", "C181", "C18", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Some 790,000 tonnes of lignite had already mined and were ready for shipment.\"However, we hope to store some 9.0 million tonnes of coal at the power plants by December, to be on the safe side during the coming winter,\" Rancea said.Romania was plunged into an energy crisis last winter when cold weather arrived earlier than expected and triggered unprecedented power consumption.A shortage of hard currency to import fuel as well as high coal and fuel oil consumption at power plants forced the Renel RA electricity authority to drastically cut power supplies to most industries from January to March.Average daily power plant coal consumption is 70,000 tonnes in summer and up to 140,000 in winter.\"Last winter, we had consumption peaks of 180,000 tonnes a day. On April 28, our coal stocks were nil,\" Rancea said.Rancea said his ministry had asked the government to approve the import of some 3.0 million tonnes of hard coal, to supplement existing stocks and build up emergency reserves.Forecasts indicate unusually cold weather will arrive in September, forcing power plants to raise output and consume more coal than normal, he added.\"So far, Renel received approval to purchase 1.0 million tonnes of hard coal,\" he said.Ministry data show Romania has mined 23 million tonnes of lignite and 3.47 million tonnes of hard coal since January. Ministry estimates put 1996 coal production at some 44 million tonnes, around last year's level.Romanian coal production fell sharply after the end of communist rule in December 1989. In 1992, output fell to a low of 28 million tonnes, against a peak of 61 million in 1989.Annual domestic demand is around 45 million tonnes.

Curren suffered from chronic fatique syndrome and other ailments that left her incapacitated and in constant pain, according to Kevorkian.The Oakland County medical examiner said Curren, a registered nurse and the mother of two children, was overweight but had no terminal disease.On Thursday, a spokesman for the coroner said Curren died from an intravenous injection of a poisonous substance, making her death a homicide.In the poll by EPIC/MRA, a Lansing, Mich.-based company, 30 percent of the 600 active voters contacted in Michigan thought the Curren death showed Kevorkian was getting reckless in his methods and should be controlled.Twenty-two percent thought Kevorkian was always wrong to help others die, while 39 percent said they supported the 68-year-old retired pathologist.\"What I'm beginning to see here is there is a possibility that if Kevorkian keeps this style up, then I think legislation could be crafted to put a stop to some of his actions,\" said Ed Sarpolus, vice president of EPIC/MRI.The poll was conducted Aug. 20-22 and had a margin of error of 4 percent.Respondents were also asked if Michigan should again ban assisted suicides. Forty-one percent said the government should stay out of the issue, while 34 percent said rules should be devised to prevent abuses.Twenty-two percent said legislators should impose another law prohibiting assisted suicide. Michigan had a temporary ban on the practice except when a physician acted to relieve pain and suffering, but the law expired in November 1994 after legislators refused to renew the ban.Michael Schwartz, one of Kevorkian's attorneys, said Thursday the poll's first question was not a referendum on his client's methods because it was biased.Instead of just referring to the coroner's finding about Curren's condition, the question should have mentioned that her own doctors confirmed she had a serious illness and was in great pain, he said.\"It's a loaded question,\" said Schwartz.Schwartz said the second finding confirmed that people continued to support what Kevorkian was doing.

The climate was such in 1988 that many thought that such transfers were just pie in the sky,\" U.N. spokeswoman Nancy Borman told Reuters.\"It makes sense to have the fund and cross-border cooperation...drugs can come from one country, traffickers from another and the proceeds from drugs laundered in yet another country,\" she added.Funds set up in several countries containing cash from drugs proceeds or from the sale of seized property bought with drugs money are estimated to total hundreds of millions of dollars.The U.N. drugs body said it was encouraged by a new commitment among many states to legislate against money laundering, cutting off a major lifeline for traffickers.Broad new anti-money laundering laws have recently been adopted in such countries as Australia, the United States, Britain, Germany, Canada and Japan.South Africa's ruling African National Congress said on Monday parliament would soon study new legislation against money laundering that puts the onus on banks and other institutions to report suspicious transactions.Ironically, Austria, the home of the drugs agency and other U.N. organisations, has come under fire this year from the United States, which said Vienna condoned a secretive banking system that made the Alpine republic a harbour for dirty money.Washington last year ranked Austria alongside Colombia, Venezuela and Thailand in a league table of countries that tolerate money laundering.The European Commission has ordered Vienna to start taking steps to outlaw anonymous bank accounts, in which huge amounts of dirty money, in particular from Eastern Europe, are believed to be deposited.Austria, the only EU country which permits nameless accounts, has ignored the Commission's demands, arguing that the accounts were part of tradition and a symbol of personal liberty.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

It has not been determined.\"She reiterated the utility would not seek to recoup costs at Millstone stemming from its operating history or from its inclusion on the NRC's \"watch list\" of nuclear reactors that need commission approval before restart.But NU might still seek compensation for purchased power.Humphreys said NU last week asked the DPU to extend by 45 days the deadline for seeking a rate increase to cover the cost of its power purchases.On July 24, NU's subsidiary Western Massachusetts Electric Co. agreed with the Massachusetts Attorney General not to pass on nuclear cost increases to its customers.\"They (NU) don't seem to be getting help from any quarter,\" said Gruntal & Co. analyst Penelope Adelmann, noting that NU's financial status forced it to cut its annual dividend to $1 a common share from $1.76 a share last month.Adelmann said the health of NU would improve with restart of the Millstone nuclear units, but the degree of improvement would depend on which unit resumed operation first.\"If (Millstone) unit 3 comes back on line, it would depend on NRC's attitude on one and two,\" she said. \"(Units) one and two are being questioned more than three.\"While there are still no firm restart dates for any of the Millstone units, the Connecticut Yankee plant is seen returning to the power grid sometime in late autumn.Meanwhile, NU estimates it has cost about $25 million to $30 million a month to buy replacement power for the Millstone units from other electricity producers.", "label": ["C24", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

We are now in contact with Burundian authorities to establish what will happen to those people who don't want to return,\" he said.The refugee flood swelled after Burundian troops killed three refugees as they tried to flee Magara camp on Sunday.

We hope they will not stop others going back,\" Stromberg said.He said after all those refugees who wanted to leave Magara had done so a repatriation campaign would move on to the last Rwandan refugee camp in Burundi at Rukuramigabo, which has some 13,000 Rwandans.There were 135,000 Rwandan refugees in Burundi at the start of the year.Refugees accuse the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army, which seized power on July 25, of a deliberate campaign of harassment and say they are leaving because they fear for their lives.The flood of Rwandan Hutus this month from Burundi is the biggest mass movement homewards since a total of two million Rwandans fled to Burundi, Tanzania and Zaire in 1994 during civil war and the genocide of up to one million people by Hutus.\"It is good to return.

Prasad Wagle, another former senior JavaSoft engineer who is among the founding engineers at Internet Startup, said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using Java to make networked applications ubiquitious.One feature of the Java language is that small software programs, known as \"applets\" because they are small applications, can be downloaded from the server computers at the center of networks onto individual computers for use.In this model, individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programs and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time, also saving costs of memory and storage.Chris Zuleeg, a veteran of Apple and a former JavaSoft marketing manager, is vice president of marketing at Internet Startup, whose Web site is www.internetstartup.com.\"The company name may need some work,\" Bidzos said in a statement. \"But we are confident that our products will integrate and simplify for end-users some major breakthrough technologies, including VeriSign Digital IDs.\"Bessemer has funded numerous Internet pioneers, including PSI Net, VeriSign, and Individual.-sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau, +1 415 846 5400", "label": ["C11", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee left interest rates unchanged at its meeting Tuesday, leaving economists and analysts pondering what the central bank might do next.Some analysts said that while Fed policy-makers resisted pressures this summer to raise short-term rates, economic data over the coming weeks may force them to raise rates later this year.However, other analysts -- and some former Federal Reserve officials -- said that mixed economic data and a touch of political pressure might be the recipe for steady monetary policy through the November presidential election.Members of the Federal Open Market Committee are expected to be careful as they juggle upcoming data, such as the August employment report due Sept. 6, and the vicissitudes of the political race for the White House.\"Every member of that FOMC is going to be very careful,\" said Preston Martin, a former Fed vice chairman who is now chairman of HomeVest Financial Services Inc. in San Francisco. \"That means that the odds build up about no action. No action is safer than some action.\"The Fed has held its target for the federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans -- at 5.25 percent since January.However, recent economic indicators suggest consumer spending and the labour market were heating up in August, although signs of a slowing manufacturing sector were seen as offsetting the growth signals.\"Before the Fed can either raise or cut interest rates in an election year, they better have a solid economic justification for doing that,\" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. \"Without the justifications, they would rather wait.\"Some analysts said the latest string of economic indicators painted a blurry economic outlook, meaning the Fed will probably stand pat until the picture clears.\"I think they will stand still and await clarification on where the economy is going,\" said Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor and currently an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.How long could that take? \"Well, I think the Fed will move sometime later this year... It may well be until very late this year, possibly even December, before the Fed knows for sure whether it needs to move or not,\" Gramley added.Gramley believes the U.S. economy is fundamentally strong but said \"some tightening will be necessary down the road.\"Martin agreed that the Fed is likely to remain on hold, \"not just because of the election, but because this (current economic scene) is a central banker nirvana.\"Martin cited a positive inflation outlook as one of the main reasons keeping the Fed on hold over the next few months.But not everyone agrees with that scenario.\"My guess is (a rate rise) is going to be right back on tap after the August data start coming out,\" said Salomon Brothers economist Brian Jones. \"There is a good chance they'll go (up) at the Sept. 24 FOMC meeting.\"Despite signs of strong economic growth, inflation remains quite low historically, and Fed leaders have refrained from raising rates in the absence of more troubling data. But upcoming employment data could change all that, analysts said.Persistent job growth threatens to shatter the economy's recent low-inflation trend and the Fed will not stand idly and watch that happen, they said.\"The job market is still quite firm. We'll need to see jobless claims move back up pretty soon in order to confirm the economic slowdown story,\" said Josh Feinman, global markets economist at BT Securities Corp.The four-week moving average of jobless claims' reached a seven-year low last week, adding to recent warnings of pending wage inflation.That also suggests the economy continues to churn out new jobs at a pace likely to drag the unemployment rate lower than July's 5.4 percent reading, analysts said.The absence of faster inflation amid such robust job creation has many analysts scratching their heads and wondering how long the Fed will hold monetary policy steady.\"Strong job growth has persisted long enough that the Fed will certainly have to stand up and take notice,\" said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Fargo Bank.Critics initially blasted the Fed for failing to raise rates at its July FOMC meeting when a report just two days later showed 239,000 new jobs created in June.But a month later the July report showed a decline to 193,000 in new non-farm payrolls and, perhaps more important, a slight drop in average hourly earnings.Fed officials had predicted a slowdown in real gross domestic product from the robust 4.2 percent second-quarter clip. The dip in payroll growth suddenly made that forecast look brilliant, analysts said.\"So far the Fed has done the right thing by keeping its powder dry,\" Schlossberg said. \"There is still a risk the Fed could fall behind the curve, but right now it looks like the economic slowdown is happening.\"", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "M131", "M13", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Joseph Lopez, Carl Bildt, the international community's High Representative to Bosnia and Robert Frowick, who is running Bosnia's first post-war election.The international community has been keen to promote freedom of the press in Bosnia as part of its preparations for the election, which will be held on September 14.It has committed about $10 million to the Open Broadcast Network (OBN).A senior Bosnian government official, who asked not to be named, said on Thursday that the government was not against OBN broadcasting news programmes.\"We have no problem if they want to broadcast news and political programming for a couple of hours every night,\" the official said.\"But they are asking for six hours of time every day and they say they will be showing commercials. That's what we object to. We don't want a network broadcasting commercial programming on our airwaves.\"OBN will consist of five local, independent stations -- two in Sarajevo, and one each in Tuzla, Mostar and Zenica. All are operating with upgraded equipment provided by international donors in recent months.Diplomats say the network would provide an alternative source of information to media controlled by the ruling parties of Bosnia's ethnic communities.The appearance of a rival network, financed by foreign funds, just weeks before national elections are to be held has not been welcome, according to diplomats. They say the ruling Moslem nationalist SDA party has gone out of its way to prevent the network going on the air with shared programming.The OBN hub, which is under construction, has been harassed by the Bosnian government and police, the diplomats report.The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), is responsible under the Dayton peace accord for the Bosnian election.It has ordered the government to \"grant without delay to the Open Broadcast Network all necessary licences, including the right to broadcast and feed via satellite, frequencies, (and) permissions to use and develop sites\".Should the Bosnian government refuse to comply, OSCE could levy fines, remove SDA candidates from the ballot or ban the SDA from upcoming elections entirely.Diplomats said on Thursday they expected the government to drop its opposition rather than incur those sorts of penalties.\"Barring an act of God or an extreme act by the Bosnian government, we expect the OBN to be up and running by the end of the first week in September with six hours of programming a day,\" said a U.S. diplomat who asked not to be named.", "label": ["C13", "C22", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "U.S. spot natural gas prices, on the defensive this summer from a steady flow of cool eastern temperatures, should gain heading into winter, helped by some supportive fundamentals, natural gas analysts said.Despite recent inventory gains, they said low stocks may still hold the key to a seasonal boost, as operators protect storage and buy spot to meet early winter demand.\"Based on what happened last year, I don't expect heavy withdrawals early, which should keep spot prices firm,\" said Susan Bertsch, analyst at Bonner and Moore in Houston.  Last year, operators went into the heating season light on inventory, then got hit with a long, cold winter that depleted stocks to record lows.The unexpected surge in heating demand last winter forced some Midwest and Northeast utilities to pay up to $30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for incremental gas.Bertsch expects prices at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point in Erath, La., to steadily climb from the current $1.95-2.00 area, peaking in the $2.50s by December.Chris Eades, gas analyst at UBS Securities in New York, also sees favorable fundamentals heading into winter.  \"The storage situation is very positive for gas prices. We don't think stocks will reach normal levels by the heating season, and if we get a normal winter, you could see a tight market,\" Eades said.Eades expects the fourth quarter composite wellhead price to move up to the $1.95 area, from the low-$1.80s today. U.S. Gulf wellhead prices on average are 10 cents under pipeline.While recent weekly American Gas Association (AGA) data have shown healthy inventory builds, especially in the critical Consuming Region East, overall stocks are still 402 billion cubic feet (bcf), or 17 percent, below 1995 levels.  \"For the Northeast and Midwest, stocks are pretty much on target, but (overall), it's not like storage is full. We still need healthy injections to keep on target,\" Bertsch said.And Bertsch said southern stocks were seriously lagging.\"The South really has to make up some ground, but there's no way they will catch up,\" she said, noting stocks there were 30 points below year-ago, while Midwest and Northeast stocks were at a seven to nine point deficit.And while demand this summer has waned because of weather, consumption for the full year is still expected to rise by 2.2 percent, according to AGA, an industry trade group.\"Demand should be strong. In 1996, we were looking for one to two percent growth,\" Eades said, noting strong residential and commercial growth this year has been partly offset by a sharp decline in electric utility demand.At the same time, supply in 1996 has been relatively stagnant, with total dry gas production through July of 10,984 bcf compared to 11,018 bcf for the same 1995 period, DOE said.Despite the late summer price slide that saw the Hub crater from the $2.60s in early July to below $2.00 today, Dave Gipson, analyst at Houston-based Pace Consultants, also sees higher ground ahead.\"Prices will move up ahead of winter. If we continue to get heavy injections and get normal weather, we're looking at the $2.20s (at Henry Hub) by winter,\" Gipson said, adding stocks will likely be at historical lows to start the season.He said flat production and a modest gain in demand this year should also help tighten the balance.But while most saw higher prices later this year, some said increased drilling could haunt the market in 1997.\"It's my only fundamental concern right now. The rig count for gas has been running close to 500 for the last few months and that's the highest we've seen since 1990,\" Eades said.--New York Power Desk 212-859-1624", "label": ["M14", "M143", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Aegon upgraded the forecast from an expected rise of between seven and 12 percent it had given in May.Earnings per share rose to 2.69 guilders in the first half of 1996 from 2.34 in the same period of 1995.Growth in premium income was a strong 21 percent.\"In addition to the solid growth in the Netherlands and the United States, Scottish Equitable and AB-Aegon in Hungary showed even stronger growth,\" Aegon said.Aegon holds an 80 percent stake in Scottish Equitable, which will gradually increased to 100 percent by the end of 1998.Aegon said currency exchange rates had a positive effect on the results in the first six months of about 1.5 percent.Aegon shares, already firm before the figures were released, were quoted 3.00 guilders higher at 83.30 by mid-afternoon.But analysts were divided over the outlook for the share.\"Aegon shares will not outperform the market after today,\" said analyst Daan Worm of ING Barings.\"I stick to my sell advice for the stock,\" he said, adding the share was relatively expensive.Suez said the stock could rise as high as 90 guilders. \"I foresee a new high for Aegon shares,\" said Van Geest, adding this would certainly happen if official rates moved down.-- Wendy Braanker, Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000", "label": ["C151", "C152", "C15", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "New York, Aug 28 Reuter - Comparing the possible post-election New Zealand political scene to troubled Turkey, a leading international economist has warned of economic \"disaster\" if a left wing coalition takes power in Wellington.David Hale, a global analyst with Zurich Kemper Investments Inc in Chicago, said there was widespread concern in international markets that New Zealand's lavishly praised economic reforms would come to an abrupt halt if the ruling National Party were dumped by the electorate in October.  \"And the big question is whether a three-party coalition of left wing parties is a possibility,\" Hale said in an interview.\"Some believe it is, with the likelihood of (NZ First leader) Winston Peters taking over as Prime Minister,\" he said.\"I can tell you that makes for a very nervous bond market.\"The New Zealand government has gone to great lengths to reassure international markets there would not be fundamental change even if there was a new prime minister appointed after the October 12 election.  Finance Minister Bill Birch told the New York business community in June that the basic framework of the reformed New Zealand economy would remain in place regardless of who came to power.This upcoming election is New Zealand's first under a proportional voting system called mixed member proportional (MMP), which is seen likely to deliver a coalition government.However economists remain concerned that the New Zealand political and economic scene is poised for a mini-revolution.  Recent polls have shown the three main opposition parties -- Labour, economic nationalist New Zealand First and the left-wing Alliance -- between them have 57 percent support.Support for the governing National Party had slipped to 34 percent, its lowest share of the party vote since May 1994.It is widely expected that Labour and NZ First will be able to strike a deal after the election, but a NZ First-National coalition is seen as also possible, but less likely.Hale said the Labour Party would be committing suicide and was likely to split in half if it was decided to form a coalition to form a new government.  \"New Zealand is the focus of the region at the moment,\" he said.\"If a coalition was formed they would have a very hostile personality, it's analogous to Turkey in terms of personal animosity, but they might well do it with Winston Peters as prime minister,\" Hale said.\"If they did, you would have a real disaster for both the currency and bonds,\" Hale said.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The European Union has provided a little relief to developing nations hit by soaring bread prices by agreeing to cushion purchase costs for European wheat for the first time in 15 months.The move to help ex-colonies eases curbs on EU wheat exports including a rare export tax imposed last year in a tight world grain market after drought in several regions. Harvests are better this year.Against this background, EU grain officials meeting in Brussels on Thursday agreed to pay an export subsidy of 3.9 Ecus ($5) per tonne to assist the sale of wheat to one or more of the 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) nations who depend on the EU for trade relief.The subsidy, worth $100,000, or four percent of a wheat cargo, applies to just one shipment of 20,000 tonnes and represents a fraction of the ACP's $200 million annual wheat import bill from the European Union.But the decision was seen as a gesture towards some of the world's poorest nations who have voiced increasing frustration with record grain bills and European export curbs this year.\"There was a feeling we had to do something. We have an agreement with these countries,\" said one official.The EU grants preferential trade terms to ACP nations, most of them former European colonies, under the Lome trade pact.ACP members Ivory Coast and Senegal have both appealed to the EU's executive Commission for help with grain costs in the past months, diplomats said.Wheat export subsidies, once a weapon in EU trade wars with the United States, were abandoned from May 1995 when prices started soaring due to a plunge in world grain reserves.In December, the EU went further and introduced an export tax. It added a premium to European wheat to prevent a run on the continent's depleted grain stocks and head off inflation.But after reaching all-time highs earlier this year, wheat prices have dropped sharply as big new harvests replenish silos in the northern hemisphere. Chicago wheat futures are below $5 per bushel after a \"spike\" in March to $7.50. Despite the new subsidy award, however, the EU signalled it was not ready to abandon export taxes for non-ACP buyers.", "label": ["C13", "C312", "C31", "CCAT", "G15", "G153", "GCAT", "M141", "M14", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

He reminded Coulthard that under NIE's proposals, average domestic customer power bills would fall by 35 pounds next year, rising to 50 pounds per year by 2002.\"I have never heard anything so oustandingly outlandish,\" he told reporters. \"Where on earth the man got this...from is beyond me. We unreservedly refute the nonsense of it.\"\"If this is what passes for dialogue at Offer (the Office of Electricity Regulation) it is quite obvious why we need to have our review assessed by the MMC.\"NIE's troubled shares hit another year low of 322 pence, a loss of 11 pence. Most analysts had been surprised at the savage review, but did not believe the group would risk further uncertainty by asking for a lengthy MMC investigation.Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Yamichi, said the MMC referral may prompt a similar move by National Grid, the electricity transmission network, which last week urged its shareholders to help fight its own price review.\"They (NIE) have a stronger balance sheet than National Grid, so if they think they have a lousy deal then National Grid could well follow suit,\" Hawkins said. NIE chairman David Jefferies is also the chairman of the National Grid.NIE is proposing a 22 percent one-off price cut next year followed by a three percent cut in power bills in each of the next four years -- a level it calls tough but sustainable.However Offer's Northern Irish office wants prices across NIE's three main businesses cut by an average one-off 31 percent, or 68 million pounds, next April followed by a two percent cut in annual charges in the following years.Bills in Northern Ireland have traditionally been about 20 percent higher than in England and Wales, partly because of the sparse population in the area. It has around half the customers of the smallest English and Welsh regional electricity groups.NIE also blames escalating oil prices and the high prices independent generating companies charge.

No one was allowed onto the fifth floor where the teenage contestants and, presumably, Machado had their rooms.Although she was nowhere to be seen, Machado and her waistline were the talk of the town.\"It's her body, her deal. She won the crown and they shouldn't take it away from her just for putting on a few pounds,\" said Autumn Smith, the reigning Miss Alabama USA. \"But, at the same time, if I'd won Miss Universe, I'd want to look the best I possibly could for that one year,\" the tall, 21-year-old brunette added.The pageant world was jolted on Monday when officials of the Miss Venezuela Organisation said Machado had been given an ultimatum by Miss Universe organisers to shed 27 pounds (12 kg) in two weeks or risk having her title taken away.At 5 feet 7 inches (1.73 metres), she weighed 112 pounds (51 kg) in May when she became the fourth Venezuelan to win the world's top beauty title. Immediately after winning, she told reporters she planned to do \"something I haven't been able to do in three weeks: eat, eat, eat and sleep.\"People close to her said she succumbed to a passion for pasta and cake.News of the alleged ultimatum sent reporters from around the United States and Latin America scrambling to get to Las Cruces and track down Machado. It also brought criticism of Miss Universe organisers, who have traditionally denied claims that pageants are glorified meat markets by stressing the importance of personality and \"inner beauty.\"They responded by saying no threats were ever made against Machado and that they were \"distressed\" by the reports.\"A weight requirement is not part of our titleholder employment contract,\" said Martin Brooks, president of Los Angeles-based Miss Universe Inc. He said the organisation was \"extremely happy with Alicia and feel she fulfils her obligations as Miss Universe 1996 exceptionally well.\"Venezuelan pageant organisers also backed away from their earlier comments. \"She obviously has a weight problem which affects her swimsuit contracts but this does not mean she will be stripped of her crown,\" one official said on Tuesday.Teen pageant officials reassured the 51 contestants that reports of an ultimatum to Machado were false and that personality and friendly disposition were as valued as ever.\"They told us it was all totally not true,\" said Jodi Webb, 18, the reigning Miss Teen Utah.David Regalado, a New Mexico policeman on guard duty at the hotel, said he had not seen Machado in person but did see her on television and was impressed. \"She sure is beautiful. They say she got fat but she looks just fine to me,\" he said.News of Machado's weight gain made front-page news in her home country.

He would not elaborate.However, analysts suspect Richfood might announce adding major customers or making another acquisition.Much of Richfood's growth in the past five years has been through acquisitions. Its revenue was $3.25 billion for the fiscal year ended April 27, up from $2.99 billion the previous fiscal year, and $1.01 billion in 1991.Net income for fiscal 1996 was $37.1 million, or $1.19 per share, after a $12 million one-time charge for expenses relating to its merger with Supe Rite Corp. as well as a $2.2 million extraordinary loss related to early debt retirement. Excluding the charge and loss, earnings were $47 million, or $1.51 a share. That compares with $39.2 million, or $1.26, in the previous fiscal year.Richfood doubled its size last year when it acquired Harrisburg, Pa.-based Super Rite, making it the fourth-largest grocery wholesaler.", "label": ["C152", "C15", "C31", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Daimler-Benz AG, Germany's largest conglomorate, is expected to report first half results on Thursday showing it has rebounded from 1995 when it posted the highest loss ever seen at a German company.Analysts said they expect Daimler to have earned a net profit of around 600 to 700 million marks ($475 million), which would be a record recovery from a 5.7 billion mark loss last year.\"Daimler is on the right track,\" said analyst Klaus-Juergen Melzner at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.Daimler will announce its results at 1200 GMT on Wednesday. Analysts expected sales to increase about nine percent from 48.04 billion marks in the first half of 1995.The company, which is trying to increase transparency of its books and make its shares more attractive to investors, will report its results according to U.S. accounting standards.Nearly all the gains will come from Daimler's truck and car division, Mercedes-Benz, which some expect to report a first half profit of around 1.49 million marks and 2.5 billion marks for the year as a whole.Analysts said a stronger dollar and sales of its E-class model, which accounts for the largest share of Mercedes car sales, are fuelling better results at Mercedes.\"The Mercedes car division is going gang-busters,\" said Stephen Reitman, analyst at Merrill Lynch.Mercedes trucks, which face a difficult market, especially in west Europe, meanwhile will probably just about break even during the first half, analysts added.As strong as Mercedes might be, Daimler's profits should be hurt by continuing losses at its air and space division, Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (DASA).DASA, which last year undertook a massive reorganisation and dumped its money-losing Dutch aircraft maker Fokker NV, is still in the red as it makes further efforts to cut costs and is profiting only slowly from a pick up in the global aircraft market.The German magazine Der Spiegl reported earlier this month that DASA would post a loss of around half a billion marks this year.Spiegel said Daimler as a group would report a first half profit of 700 million marks and two billion marks for the year as a whole. The company reported a 1.6 billion mark loss in the first half of 1995.The group's financial and services unit, Daimler-Benz InterServices (debis), is expected to have increased its profits during the first half, but by such a small amount as to have little impact on the conglomorate's overall profits.Better six months results would be the first sign that Daimler has turned around after last year's huge losses.Indeed, 1995 will go down in the company's history as a watershed.Chairman Juergen Schrempp took painful steps to increase profitability, hiving off Daimler's unprofitable AEG AG unit, cutting off funds for Fokker, and telling each line of business that it must increase return on capital employed to 12 percent.Last year, the group took one-off charges of 3.9 billion marks, including a 2.3 billion mark write-down of Fokker and 1.6 billion marks for streamlining AEG.Although the bold management strokes resulted in massive losses, Schrempp won praise from analysts and many in Germany's business community for making the kind of tough decisions needed to ensure Daimler's international competitiveness.($1=1.4747 Mark)", "label": ["C15", "C152", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Boris Yeltsin's new security chief plunged Moscow politics into chaos on Tuesday, challenging the authenticity of presidential decrees on the Chechnya crisis and raising speculation on whether Yeltsin was still running Russia.Aides to the 65-year-old president, seen only once in public since he was re-elected seven weeks ago, insisted he was not ill but he remained out of sight.His spokesman denied a new report he was being treated for a serious heart condition and said he had left Moscow for a short holiday.Tough-talking ex-general Alexander Lebed, just two months in his job as Security Council secretary and already at loggerheads with some Kremlin insiders, issued a statement saying Yeltsin's latest decrees on Chechnya bore only a facsimile signature and seemed to have been prepared without his participation.A decree ordering Lebed to restore Russian control of Grozny, which was seized by separatist rebels on August 6, was the cue for the army to prepare a massive bombardment of the Chechen capital and would wreck Lebed's peacemaking efforts, the Security Council statement said.Lebed, whom Yeltsin named his personal representative to Chechnya last week, would make his third trip in 10 days to the region on Wednesday, Itar-Tass news agency said.Yeltsin started a two-day break in the picturesque lakeland of Valdai in northwestern Russia on Tuesday, the presidential press service said.Spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin would consider a longer holiday in Valdai but dismissed as \"complete rubbish\" a report by Ekho Moskvy radio that the president had been in a specialist cardiological centre since August 15.Journalists at Ekho Moskvy told Reuters they stuck by their story. which said Yeltsin, who had two heart attacks last year, had been diagnosed as having moderately serious heart trouble.\"In the coming hours the question of carrying out a surgical operation may be decided,\" the radio said.Yastrzhembsky on Monday had denied a Time magazine report that the Kremlin was considering transferring Yeltsin to a Swiss clinic for a bypass operation.He said the president and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who would deputise for Yeltsin if he were incapable of working, were continuing to work on formation of the new government, most of which was announced last week.There was no immediate response to Lebed's charges.\"The contents of the documents give solid grounds to doubt that the president of Russia took a direct part in finalising the text of the order,\" the Security Council statement said.The decree, it added, had given the army commander in the region his cue to announce he would launch an all-out air and artillery bombardment of the city from Thursday morning, having given tens of thousands of citizens 48 hours to flee.Terrified civilians flooded out of Grozny on Tuesday.The refugees, many of them with little more than the clothes they stood up in, said Russian planes had started bombing the town, much of it already in ruins after attacks at the start of Russia's campaign to crush Chechnya's independence bid.\"The whole city is on its way out,\" said Nina Madayeva, who said 12 planes had bombed Grozny's southwestern Chernorechye district overnight. \"We've been in a basement for 14 or 15 days and couldn't stand it any more.\"Russian commander, General Konstantin Pulikovsky, who had signed a ceasefire order on Saturday, accused the guerrillas of using the truce to dig in.\"I see force as the only way out of the situation in Grozny,\" he told Interfax news agency.Rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov appealed to Lebed, who has held talks with the rebels, to rein in Pulikovsky's troops.He should \"use all of his influence to stop the approaching madness\", Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Mystery around Russia's \"invisible\" President Boris Yeltsin thickened on Wednesday amid awkward Kremlin explanations, and some newspapers said an early race to replace him was already under way.\"An unannounced, under-the-carpet presidential campaign has started in the country,\" the authoritative Izvestia newspaper said on Wednesday.\"The pussyfooting around the agreement which General (Alexander) Lebed has brought from Chechnya testifies to this.\"Yeltsin, who disappeared for a holiday on Monday, has charged his security chief Lebed with finding a solution to the Chechnya conflict which has killed at least 30,000 people and strained Moscow's relations with the West.Lebed struck a military deal with the rebels last week but his pleas for Yeltsin to hear his plans for a political settlement have fallen on seemingly-deaf ears.\"The president is studying the documents,\" is the Kremlin's answer to Lebed's request for a meeting -- or at least a telephone conversation.Without the Chechnya crisis, August would have appeared the most convenient time for Yeltsin, 65, to take a break.He won a gruelling election against a communist challenger with crucial help from Lebed, a first-round contender, and put a new government in place.The Chechen conflict has triggered a power struggle in the Kremlin as fragile peace prospects grow stronger.The Kremlin -- in the absence of vacationing chief-of-staff Anatoly Chubais -- has answered so many questions so vaguely, if at all, that independent observers are asking where the president is and what is wrong with him.Yeltsin, who had two heart attacks last year, effectively disappeared from the public eye before the runoff election on July 3, and his wooden 45-second inauguration speech on August 9 did little to quell speculation about his health.A brief television appearence later was taped by a trusted crew and, unusually for Russia, cameras from state television channels were not even present.He is spending his vacation at the private and exclusive Rus hunting lodge, some 100 km (60 miles) from Moscow, but he has not met any officials there and has not appeared on television.A spokesman for the presidential press service summed it up on Wednesday by saying: \"We do not have any information about the president because he is on holiday.\"Another Kremlin official, asked to comment on rumours that Yeltsin was ill, said simply: \"We have no official information on any worsening or any change in the president's state of health.\"The choice of the hunting lodge instead of the well-equipped Barvikha resort and sanatorium near Moscow also appears strange, given that aides have said that the Kremlin chief needs thorough medical checks.There is also a personal angle -- Yeltsin left his beloved wife Naina behind in a Moscow hospital after she underwent kidney surgery on Saturday. A Kremlin spokesman said on Wednesday Naina was getting ready to leave hospital.Before the Russian election campaign started, Naina made clear she did not want Yeltsin to stand again. But she remained loyally at his side through the campaign, travelling with him across Russia and smiling as he spoke.Some analysts say Lebed, who finished a strong third in the first round of the election, is using his peace efforts in Chechnya to boost his chances if a new poll is held early.\"If he stops this shameful war, he will become a national hero with strong chances of becoming a hero with official powers in the future,\" said Izvestia.But it might be too early to write Yeltsin off.He danced and travelled non-stop before the first round of the presidential election in a sharp contrast to the end of last year when he looked like a slow-moving political corpse, slurring his words like late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

They need our love and compassion.\"The diminutive Roman Catholic missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an Indian nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure.But an attending doctor said Mother Teresa, who turns 86 next Tuesday, was conscious and in stable condition.The task Mother Teresa began alone in 1949 in the slums of densely-populated Calcutta, and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world.When in 1979 she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize, she said characteristically: \"I am unworthy.\"The world disagreed, showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna, or Jewel of India, the country's highest civilian award.Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker. A year later, the Vatican announced she was stepping down as Superior of her Missionaries of Charity order.More than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor. They could not agree, so asked her to stay on. She agreed.In 1991, Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia.In 1993, she fell in Rome and broke three ribs. In August the same year, while in New Delhi to receive yet another award, she developed malaria, complicated by her heart and lung problems. Last April she fractured her left collar bone.But her increasing frailty, arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate.Mother Teresa was born Agnes Goinxha Bejaxhiu to Albanian parents in Skopje, in what was then Serbia, on August 27, 1910.She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 12. At the age of 18 she became a Loretto nun, hoping to work at the Order's Calcutta mission.She was sent to Loretto Abbey in Dublin and from there to India to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in Calcutta.She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September, 1946. \"The message was quite clear,\" she told one interviewer. \"I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. I knew where I belonged.\"The Vatican and the mother superior in Dublin approved and after intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first Calcutta slum school in December 1949.She took the name of Teresa, after France's Saint Therese of the Child Jesus. In India she was simply called Mother.Mother Teresa set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in Calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital. Named \"Nirmal Hriday\" (Tender Heart), it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying, destitute people, admitting nearly 18,000 a year.Her Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in 1949, now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in India and abroad.In 1994 a British television documentary called the myth around Mother Teresa a mixture of \"hyperbole and credulity\".

{"token": "Israel thwarted Yasser Arafat's call for a mass prayer protest at Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque on Friday by ringing the city with police and roadblocks.Paramilitary police turned back worshippers at checkpoints along the border between Arab East Jerusalem and the West Bank.Barely 20,000 Moslems made it to the mosque complex inside Jerusalem's walled Old City, according to Palestinians. Israeli police put the number at 8,000.\"The presence today was less than normal weeks because of the unjust Israeli measures of placing roadblocks, and terrorising people, by deploying large numbers of soldiers,\" Hasan Tahboub, Minister of Islamic Affairs in the Palestinian self-rule Authority, told Reuters.The government brought extra police into the city fearing clashes after Arafat, president of the Authority, called on Palestinians to flock to Jerusalem for traditional Friday prayers to protest against Israeli policy on Jerusalem and Jewish settlement. The prayers passed off peacefully.Tahboub and Israeli authorities had expected 100,000 Arabs to heed the call. Arafat himself attended prayers in the northern West Bank town of Nablus.He launched the protest together with a general strike on Thursday while accusing the new right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of refusing to implement the Oslo self-rule accord signed by the previous centre-left Labour government.Israel drew Palestinian anger this week by demolishing an Arab community centre in East Jerusalem which city officials said was built illegally. It also disclosed plans to expand West Bank settlements.Arafat was also angered by Netanyahu's refusal so far to meet him and to redeploy Israeli troops in Hebron, the only West Bank town still under occupation.Soldiers placed roadblocks at the Gush Etzion Jewish settlements near Hebron to prevent Moslems travelling to Jerusalem on Friday.Hebronites who skirted that checkpoint were held up at another outside Bethlehem.\"I want to go through in solidarity with Arafat,\" said Mohammad Kaharan, one of groups of middle-aged and old men arguing in vain with soldiers in the heat haze of the Bethlehem road.Young men did not even try to cross as police routinely turn back teenagers and men in their 20s since suicide attacks on Israelis began in 1994.Arafat has cracked down on Moslem opponents of his 1993 peace deal with Israel since the last wave of suicide bombings six months ago. He feels angry and frustrated that this and other moves demanded by Israel have been ignored by Netanyahu, his aides say.Arafat aide Nabil Abu Rdainah said talks overnight between Netanyahu adviser Dore Gold and top PLO official Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, made no progress on any issue.Gold and Abu Mazen met in Tel Aviv hours after the Palestinians ended the general strike, the first in the West Bank and Gaza in two years.\"The Israelis are still delaying and dragging their feet on all issues,\" Abu Rdainah told Reuters.\"The peace process is still paralysed, the resumption of negotiations in practical terms is frozen and the contacts until now have not led to any results at all,\" Abu Rdainah said.Netanyahu's office said it would not comment on the talks which followed a first meeting in Jerusalem between the chairmen of the Israel-Palestinian Steering Committee which oversees implentation of self-rule agreements.The Steering Committee will begin next week to convene on a regular basis, Israeli chairman Dan Shomron said.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Greece is still the worst performer in the 12-member EU despite 10 years of austerity programmes.\"Our country must take all necessary measures and decisions so it does not become marginalised in the European Union's political and economic integration,\" Simitis said.Greek markets marched higher for the third straight day on Thursday after a long period of stagnation in anticipation of the announcement of an early election.The Athens general share index finished 0.76 percent higher from Wednesday's close and more gains were expected on Friday.\"The stock market likes the short pre-election period and discounts the election of a strong government that will tackle Greece's structural economic prblems,\" Yannis Kalogerakis, head of trading at ABN AMRO Axias Securities, told Reuters.Simitis took over as prime minister from late socialist party founder Andreas Papandreou in January and was then elected president of the PASOK party at a congress in June.He sees the future of Greece tied firmly to the EU and to the relief of many western diplomats his prime ministerial style is the antithesis of Papandreou's flamboyant, crowd rousing showmanship.\"These will be the most quiet elections in modern Greek history,\" a government official said. \"No big rallies, no plastic flags, no false promises.\"The conservative opposition New Democracy party accused Simitis of lying to the Greek people because he had said during the congress he would not call an early poll.Conservative leader Miltiades Evert expressed optimism that he would win the elections, but he lags far behind Simitis in polls and is even less popular than many other New Democracy members.Analysts said Simitis had felt that, if elections were held as scheduled next year, he would pay the political cost of unpopular measures such as spending cuts in public services and below-inflation pay rises.His finance minister, Alexandros Papadopoulos, is putting together next year's budget, which includes cuts of $1.2 billion in state spending and a restructuring of public companies to boost growth, expected to exceed 2.5 percent of Greek GDP this year.Papadopoulos has warned that the country is still a long way from meeting the criteria needed to join European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999 and that in the next two years they must make sacrifices to slash inflation and a towering public debt.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Palmerston North-based animal eartag company Allflex New Zealand Ltd is to phase out its manufacturing arm over the next year after its U.S.owners decided to relocate this work overseas, the New Zealand Press Association reported on Friday.The down-sizing would mean the loss of about 130 jobs as the manufacturing site becomes largely a distribution warehouse for the New Zealand market.Manufacturing will now be carried out at locations in North America, France, and China.  Staff at Allflex, founded in Palmerston North in the 1960s and now a world leader in animal and electronic identification systems, were told of the plans this morning.Former general manager Jim Stewart, who is chief executive officer for the company's electronic weighing division, said there would be a staff of about 100 once restructuring was completed.Allflex currently employs 235 people at the plant, although this number can rise to 400 at the height of the manufacturing season.  The operations of Allflex NZ Ltd and Allflex Australia Pty Ltd would be merged under the management of the Allflex Australasian board.The parent company, Allflex SA, is owned by New York investment bank Goldman Sachs.Stewart said that to manufacture the products in Palmerston North Allflex had to bring in all raw material from overseas, which involved high freight rates.It was then reprocessed in Palmerston North and promptly transported back to where we bought the raw material from.  Stewart said the lack of significant capital expenditure on upgrading manufacturing plant in earlier years, coupled with the impact of exchange rates and transport costs, made the high capital expenditure now required to upgrade the site's aged plant and equipment uneconomic.However, the company's electronic weighing business had been given the go-ahead to grow and expand and, if unhindered, there would be no reason why it could not eventually employ between 100 and 200 staff, he said.-- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746", "label": ["C42", "CCAT", "E41", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GJOB"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Every dollar we spend bringing in people to help these kids after school with personal tutoring is a dollar well worth it,\" he said.Later, the Clinton train passed through Rust Belt urban decay around Detroit, and stopped in Royal Oak for a rally. He spoke to a large, enthusiastic crowd gathered at a railroad crossing in town and accepted the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organisations, the country's second largest police union with 185,000 members.The reading programme, which would require congressional approval, would spend $2.75 billion over five years, most of it to hire the specialists to help communities provide extra reading help before and after school for 3 million children at 20,000 schools.Some $1 billion of the total would go to Clinton's national service programme, AmeriCorps, which the Republican-led Congress tried but failed to kill last year as an example of wasteful government spending.Lest he be accused by Republicans as a big-spending Democrat, Clinton aides said he would propose $8.4 billion in budget cuts to pay for the reading programme as well as other initiatives he will announce this week.But of course that did not stop the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole from attacking the idea.\"Instead of pursuing fundamental reform -- by confronting the teachers' unions and embracing school choice -- Bill Clinton announces a new government programme and a new pot of money for the unions,\" Dole's deputy press secretary Christina Martin said.Putting some bite into frequent administration threats to reduce so-called \"corporate welfare,\" Clinton would raise $5.3 billion over six years by limiting export-related tax breaks for multinational corporations, aides said.For 70 years, multinationals that export products abroad have been able to declare half of their export profits as income from foreign sales and therefore eligible for U.S. tax breaks. Clinton would eliminate this.\"None of these things will be popular, a lot of these things will have people who will be unhappy, but this is the real world of paying for specific savings,\" said Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "NATO announced on Saturday it was punishing the Bosnian army for two recent incidents in which the Moslem-led force showed a \"complete disregard\" for NATO rules on military ground and air movements.Lieutenant-Colonel Max Marriner, a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo, said NATO-led peace forces turned back a Bosnian army convoy on Thursday night which was travelling from Zenica to Bihac.The convoy consisted of eight buses carrying several hundred newly-trained soldiers.\"This military movement was not authorised by (NATO) and as such constitutes a serious breach of compliance,\" Marriner told reporters.\"Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Walker has decided to ban all (Bosnian Army) troop and equipment movement into the sensitive Bihac pocket until further notice.\"Walker commands all NATO-led ground forces in Bosnia, of which there are currently about 53,000.The Bosnian army had also broken NATO air traffic regulations in four incidents involving the transport of soldiers by helicopters on Friday, Marriner reported.Two of the flights were not supposed to carry any passengers and the other two carried more passengers than were authorised.\"As a result General Walker has banned all (Bosnian army) helicopter flights until further notice,\" Marriner said.NATO penalised the Bosnian Serb army in recent days by destroying about 400 tonnes of contraband Serb munitions which were discovered in a school house in Margetici, near the eastern town of Sokolac.The Serbs protested vigorously over the Margetici incident and alleged NATO bias in favour of the Moslem-led Bosnian army.NATO denied any such bias but will have been happy to have the opportunity to demonstrate even-handedness with its punishment of the Bosnian army infractions announced on Saturday, diplomats said.NATO officials report that all three of the factional armies in Bosnia have from time to time violated the military requirements laid down in the Dayton peace agreement.Margetici was the most publicised of recent violations because of the huge amount of contraband discovered.But NATO figures indicate that the Bosnian army has been guilty of more violations than the other two factions on an incident-by-incident basis.NATO is still considering what to do about 16 military sites belatedly declared by the Bosnian Serb army on August 5. The sites should have been registered for inspection months earlier.Some contain radio transmitters and other non-lethal equipment, but among the 16 sites are at least 10 locations with munitions totalling 2,600 tonnes.Theoretically, all of the material could be confiscated and destroyed. But, having made its point at Margetici, NATO might direct the Serbs to move the munitions into approved storage sites.Such a move would probably trigger a complaint from the Bosnian army that NATO is biased in favour of the Serbs.", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Anglo American's sale of a chunk of its empire to black businessmen will open the doors to more deals that will aid the economic empowerment of blacks in South Africa, analysts said Thursday.The National Empowerment Consortium (NEC), which is made up of 50 black economic interest groups, will buy a dominant stake in Anglo American's Johnnies Industrial Corp. Ltd. (Johnnic), which is valued at 4.2 billion rand ($930 million), in a deal announced Wednesday.\"It is still small compared with white South Africa, but with the first deal under the belt, the next ones should be able to progress more quickly,\" said economist Tony Twine.However, no deals on the same scale were in the pipeline.Stock in New Africa Investments Ltd., one of the NEC's main members, jumped on Thursday on news of the sale.The price leaped to a midday high of 290 cents -- up 16 percent from its previous close of 250 cents -- before retracing to 274 by early afternoon on profit-taking in brisk trade.The Johnnic sale is part of a widespread \"unbundling\" or selloff of assets by a handful of huge conglomerates which dominate South Africa's gold and mining-based economy.\"Eighty percent of the JSE (Johannesburg Stock Exchange) must be permanently twitchy because they look like giant nationalisation targets should anyone from the far left sweep to power,\" Twine said.That looks unlikely at present.President Nelson Mandela has ditched the socialist rhetoric of old for market-friendly policies, resisting pressure inside his African National Congress for government action to close the economic gap, which could become apartheid's most lasting legacy.Apart from limited state aid and land reform, blacks will have to rely on their own devices to make economic headway.Some critics say the NEC is in danger of becoming a black business monolith like its white rivals, enriching its owners but making little difference to ordinary blacks.But analysts were optimistic the Johnnic deal, clinched after two years of negotiations, could be just the jump-start fledgling black businesses need.The Johnnic sale lifts the market value of companies in which blacks have control or exercise influence to more than 90 billion rand ($20 billion), or about 10 percent of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's market capitalisation.Johnnic's assets include stakes in South African Breweries, Toyota South Africa and media companies.\"This transaction in many ways deepens and enhances the whole process of black economic empowerment,\" said chief NEC negotiator, Cyril Ramaphosa.\"It will allow the previously disadvantaged community to play a role they should have played in years past.\"Once touted as President Nelson Mandela's successor, Ramaphosa quit politics this year for business in a symbolic sign of the shift in the fight for black power from politics to the economics.Whites yielded control of government in 1994 but have ostentatiously clung on to the money and riches of South Africa.Anglo said late in 1994 it would sell its stake in Johnnic, but only to a group that would further black empowerment.\"The fact that we came out with this conclusion bodes extremely well for ...

Traders said offers were also seen around 75 cents a barrel over Singapore spot quotes, c-and-f west coast.

Other east coast offers were seen around $1.30-$1.50 per barrel over Singapore spot quotes, c-and-f.In IOC'S tender for September, east coast offers were between $2.40 and $2.96 per barrel over MidEast quotes, c-and-f.Traders said offers of 1.0 percent sulphur diesel were around 15-20 cents a barrel below the 0.5 percent grade.  Traders noted that current MidEast premiums were firm with o,5-percent sulphur diesel traded recently around $1.00 per barrel over MidEast quotes, on a free-on-board (fob) basis, while the 1.0-percent grade was around 70 cents premium, fob.The market was mixed on the volumes that IOC would take for October.Earlier estimates placed it at between 800,000 and one million tonnes. But traders are now estimating that IOC would take between 600,000 and 700,000 tonnes.  They said India was faced with a perpetual demurrage problem and several cargoes from the previous month would be rolled-over to the forward month. This might mean that IOC might not take any cargoes in the first week of October, traders said.Demand in October was also not expected to be large because the current monsoon season was limiting requirements for agricultural purposes and the rains were also fuelling hydropower supplies to the fullest.  Traders also said that if offer levels were deemed too high, IOC might also not take too much this time, especially since the government raised domestic prices for diesel by 15 percent in July.Anxieties over the smaller-than-expected volumes that IOC might take for October caused the paper market to be offered lower on Friday from its opening levels of $25.90 to $25.65 a barrel for September and October, brokers said.  However, the market was concerned by reports that the 160,000-barrel-per-day Mathura refinery would be partially shut for maintenance either in September or October for about 15 days.If the refinery were to undergo a shutdown, it could spur IOC to take more volumes in October, especially after the small amount it took in September, traders said.--Singapore newsroom (+65-8703084)", "label": ["M14", "M143", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Iraq expressed regret on Thursday that no consensus had been reached on a global nuclear test ban treaty, saying the failure could damage the credibility of the Conference on Disarmament.Ambassador Barzan Ibrahim Al-Tikriti, half-brother of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, also said the international community was seeking total disarmament and destruction of nuclear weapons worldwide.It was the first time the Iraqi delegation had addressed the main United Nations-sponsored negotiating forum on disarmament since being admitted to the Geneva talks last June.India prevented the 61-nation conference from reaching consensus last week on a draft Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) which would prohibit all nuclear explosions.However, Australia has vowed to bring the text to the U.N. General Assembly next month for signature and is marshalling support from other non-nuclear states, according to diplomats.Barzan said that his country supported the current draft.\"It is really regrettable that the text provided by the chairman of the ad hoc committee for a nuclear test ban...has not met with consensus,\" he said in a speech made in Arabic.\"Hence, the conference has faced a difficult situation that might affect its credibility as the sole negotiation forum for disarmament affairs,\" he added.The Geneva forum is expected to resume negotiations, launched in March 1995, to halt production of fissile material used in nuclear weapons -- plutonium and highly-enriched uranium.As wrapping up the CTBT negotiations was given top priority, it has made virtually no progress on the fissile \"cut-off\" talks in the last 17 months, according to delegates.Formerly head of Iraqi intelligence, Barzan has served for years as Iraq's ambassador to the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva and also has cabinent rank as presidential adviser.Barzan said that total nuclear disarmament was vital to promoting international security, improving international relations and consolidating \"confidence among states\".But he made no reference to international inspectors trying to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, as set forth under the  terms of the 1991 Gulf War ceasefire.Iraq and 22 other countries -- including Israel and Syria -- were admitted to the Geneva talks last June in a compromise deal ending a long standoff over Baghdad's participation.The United States had blocked the conference's expansion three years ago, arguing that Iraq should not be allowed to hold veto power on the conference -- which takes decisions by consensus -- while still subject to U.N. economic sanctions.Under the compromise, the 23 new members immediately gave written pledges not to individually veto the conference decisions during the first two years of their membership.After that date, any of the 23 states under sanctions defined by chapter seven of the U.N. charter would be unable to wield its veto.The conference successfully negotiated the Chemical Weapons Convention, signed in Paris in January 1993.

{"token": "On the eve of the new Dutch soccer season, Ajax Amsterdam, European champions in 1995 and runners-up in 1996, are looking out of sorts.In their last five pre-season games the Dutch champions have conceded 16 goals without themselves finding the net once.Racked by injury and bedevilled by waning confidence, the world club champions look a pale shadow of the side that in recent years has rivalled Blackbeard the pirate in capturing silverware.The latest setback, Sunday's 3-0 defeat by a strong, fluent PSV Eindhoven in the Johan Cruyff Shield, the traditional season curtain-raiser, exposed alarming deficiencies in an Ajax machine that is used to sweeping all before it.Coming hard on the heels of drubbings by AC Milan, Juventus and Spain's Deportivo La Coruna, as well as defeat against Ruud Gullit's Chelsea, the extent of PSV's superiority in all departments will worry Ajax coach Louis van Gaal.PSV, European champions in 1988 and now led by former Dutch coach Dick Advocaat, have fired a serious warning at Ajax -- it was their first win in Amsterdam for almost four years -- and they look a good bet to usurp the Dutch crown.But it would be unwise to write off Ajax, bidding for their fourth consecutive Dutch title and 27th in total, before the season kicks off in earnest.Van Gaal sees no reason to panic, preferring to blame a lengthy list of players injured or recovering, including internationals Marc Overmars, Patrick Kluivert, Winston Bogarde and Peter Hoekstra.Defections, not helped by the Bosman ruling which made stars like Edgar Davids and Michael Reiziger give-away bargains for AC Milan, have also forced Van Gaal to chop, change and improvise his line-up.\"I have to protect the players from themselves. Many of them just aren't yet fit enough for big games. Only the Boer brothers (Frank and Ronald) and (Edwin) van der Saar are really fit.\"\"I can't really change anything. Some players need time to get into a rhythm. We usually use the pre-season to get the team to build up a head of steam, but we'll have to make the most of the next games just to limit the damage,\" Van Gaal said.Dutch media have also speculated that Ajax's move to a new home, the towering multi-billion dollar Arena, has eroded the club's previous air of invincibility at the cramped de Meer stadium.\"The recent defeats hurt, they have damaged our confidence and will have given other opponents heart,\" Van Gaal said.\"Other teams will have been watching and will come here with more confidence. At the Meer we built up a fearsome reputation which we don't yet have at the Arena. We're going to have to work on that.\"Van Gaal insists he has bought wisely over the summer, replacing Davids and Reiziger, as well as the Nigerian pair Finidi George and Nwankwo Kanu.But Richard Witschge, who caught the eye during the European championships, is no Davids. His languid style, deft touch and superb passing will help when Ajax go forward. But Davids's strength was as ball-winner when the team were under pressure.Mariano Juan, the young Argentine who cannot yet communicate with his team mates, is no replacement for Bogarde, another who emerged from Dutch disappointment at Euro 96 with his reputation enhanced, while Kluivert's slow recuperation may force Van Gaal to shop around for a stand-in goalscorer.Babangida, signed from Roda to replace his fellow countryman Finidi, has looked sluggish, while both Peter Hoekstra and Finn Jari Litmanen are struggling to find form and confidence.PSV's emergence from a summer of canny buying as serious title contenders has whetted the appetite of Dutch soccer fans and may spell an end to Ajax's recent hegemony.The champions begin the defence of their title against NAC of Breda on Wednesday.", "label": ["GCAT", "GSPO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Russian troops cut a major escape route from Grozny on Tuesday, trapping thousands of civilians frantically trying to flee a threatened allout military bombardment from Thursday.The troops apparently aimed to close the route to Chechen fighters holed up in the city. But they stranded civilians in a perilous area between rebel and Russian lines which has been shelled heavily in the last few days.About 30 well-armed Interior Ministry soldiers with armoured personnel carriers (APCs) swept through the dusty village of Alkhan-Yurt on the southwest fringe of the Chechen capital.They took up positions near a ramshackle bridge that was one of the few points of passage for thousands of refugees on Tuesday.\"They started shooting up the bridge with grenades when they got down there and everyone turned back,\" said one woman who managed to cross from the Grozny side just before the Russians moved in. Sporadic explosions could be heard from the vicinity.Western journalists who visited the bridge in the early evening saw the bodies of two civilians on the Grozny side.A Chechen rebel spokesman had accused troops of blowing up the crossing at 3.30 p.m. (1130 GMT), killing many civilians.But at the bridge, a precarious structure of metal plates balanced on rusting steel tubes, there was no evidence of this later in the afternoon. Russian officials denied the charge.The troops' arrival, however, halted the flow of refugees, many of them old folk who had hobbled for several kilometres (miles) from Grozny, which was seized by the rebels on August 6.The soldiers, who were extremely agitated, searched refugees and forced men to lie on the ground. A number complained they were robbed of some of the few possesions they had been able to take along as they fled their homes.\"They shoved me onto the ground and ripped my gold ring off. Then they took my wallet with $300 in it,\" one man said.One of the APCs trained its cannon on us.\"Out of the car!\" screamed one of the blue-camouflaged soldiers, sticking his Kalashnikov assault rifle in my face.\"You damn journalists! Don't you have enough blacks in your own country? You've come here to defend these black arses we're trying to wipe out.

Black smoke from fires burning in Grozny rose in the sky over their heads.\"I didn't want to leave home but everyone says they are going to bomb everything in the city,\" said a toothless old man with one leg whom we gave a lift to.A plump old woman, tears streaming down her cheeks, confronted the soldiers. \"Why do you want to kill us?\" she said.The sea of agonised faces was broken by a single crazed smile -- a mentally handicapped man being pushed through the dust in a wheelchair.", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

He had previously lived in Britain and Australia.Bulgarian media said he was arrested for owing several months of rent.If extradited Nedialkov faces five to 30 years in prison, depending on how his crime will be qualified, prosecutors said.Pyramid investment schemes have proved popular in several other ex-communist countries, including Russia and Romania.Some 30,000 Bulgarians took a bitter lession in investment last year when $25 million sank into the several get-rich-quick schemes, after their owners fled with the money.Some of the founders of the pyramids are now under arrest while others are being investigated by Bulgarian authorities with the cooperation of Interpol.Another Bulgarian-born businessman Michael Kapustin accused of misappropriation of more than $10 million was due to be extradited from Germany this week, said Ganev.

Tensions between the two religious groups go back four centuries to the arrival of the first Christians in the area.Extremists on both sides have condemned the accord, but Misuari said he would work to persuade opponents to accept it.The agreement will establish an interim Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), to be followed in three years by a plebiscite leading to autonomous rule in the 14-province region.Misuari acknowledged at a Friday news conference he faced a \"big problem\" in getting his guerrilla followers -- which he has said numbered well over 30,000 -- out of the bush.\"I know it is a matter of explaining to them the wisdom of supporting and associating ourselves with this peace process,\" he said. Several thousand will be integrated into the Philippine armed forces and the police.\"This is a moment of great significance, not only to the government and people of the Philippines, but also to the whole region and the international community,\" Suharto said at the initialling ceremony.In Manila, Ramos said he was confident Christian opposition would fade to the peace deal after several modifications were made to the accord limiting the functions of the SPCPD.\"With the modifications introduced in the final agreement after long negotiations ... I am confident that the opposition to the peace agreement will considerably be reduced and that eventually the peace and development process will be smoothly implemented,\" Ramos said in a statement.Among the changes were the making of the study of Islam in public schools optional instead of mandatory.The initialling of the deal followed a final two-day round of intensive negotiations in Jakarta to settle last-minute differences and agree on the peace text. Final agreement was reached late on Thursday night at a central Jakarta hotel.Since substantive peace talks started in 1993, Indonesia has chaired a six-nation ministerial committee of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to facilitate negotiations and mediate between the parties. The OIC will continue its involvement in the interim peace process in Mindanao.The peace process dated back to an agreement signed under the auspices of the OIC in Tripoli in 1976, but which languished until it was revived in 1993.About 45,000 Filipino Moslems held a prayer rally in the southern city of Marawi on Friday after the deal was initialled.\"The prayer rally is to express our thanks to Allah and to President (Fidel) Ramos for having created the SPCPD and for giving peace and development in Mindanao a chance to prosper,\" Marawi mayor Abbas Basman said after the rally.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

High costs of unemployment insurance and benefits, meanwhile, have reduced purchasing power and left Swiss employers uncertain.Unemployment was expected to remain at a high level in the foreseeable future. Bischofberger expected 1997 unemployment to stay at 4.7 percent, unchanged from 1996.In several sectors, prices were seen declining.\"For the first time in the post-war years, costs and prices are falling on a broad front,\" Bischofberger said.CS forecasts consumer prices to show a rise of 0.8 percent in 1996 and a rise of 1.0 percent in 1997. But Bischofberger noted the consumer price index could overstate inflation due to price discounts and other factors.CS economists believed interest rates were unlikely to rise in the near future.

The government plans tax incentives to stimulate new investment in competitive and labour-absorbing projects.Noting the danger of a wage-price spiral, it has also stressed the need for wage moderation and said pay rises should not exceed average productivity growth.Productivity improvements are firmly on the agenda in the country's economic development. \"An important constraint preventing firms from being more productive is the lack of co-operation between management and workers,\" says Visser.South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) industrial affairs committee chairman Hugo Snickers agrees: \"The adversarial relationship that exists at the moment is obviously not conducive to productivity.\"Linked to improving workplace interaction is the focus on the quality of management and leadership.\"The country has excellent top managers but we lack good middle and junior management, people who can be the drivers of productivity,\" according to Visser.Sacob's Snickers says training must also be improved. South African business spends around 1.5 percent of payroll on training and development whereas Europe and Japan spend between six and 10 percent.Visser says Japan is an example where management and workers negotiated a social contract which guaranteed workers their jobs if productivity was raised.\"When the Japanese increased productivity, they could not reduce labour. They had to sell more products and go to international markets, forcing them to become more export-orientated.\"This, he says, is what South Africa needs to break the balance of payments constraint.The picture is not all bleak. Reserve Bank figures show labour productivity has improved this decade, rising in non-farm sectors from 0.3 percent in 1990 to 1.2 percent in 1992 and 3.2 percent in 1995.According to the NPI, multifactor productivity -- a weighted combination of labour and capital productivity -- rose 2.5 percent last year.There have been some notable advances, but South Africa has a long way to go. Anglo American Industrial Corp Ltd  associate Samcor, for example, has raised production per employee from 10 to 15 cars a year since 1994.But at an improvement rate of five vehicles a year, it will take 10 years to reach the 1994 productivity level of 65 cars per employee achieved at Ford's plant in Valencia, Spain.-- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003", "label": ["GCAT", "GJOB", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Using automobiles as a backdrop instead of his whistlestop train, President Bill Clinton on Tuesday watched a landmark Jeep Cherokee roll off the assembly line and said it was evidence of America's economic might under his stewardship.On a tour of Toledo's Chrysler Jeep Plant, Clinton watched admiringly as a midnight blue Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle came off the line.It was the 2 millionth such vehicle manufactured at the plant since they began producing them here in 1983. Factory workers cheered, \"Jeep! Jeep! Jeep!\" It had right-handed steering meaning it was intended for export to Japan.Speaking to employees afterward, Clinton said from a stage flanked by Jeep Cherokees that American exports symbolised by Jeeps have prospered since he became president because of his negotiation of trade agreements.\"You proved one more time that whenever we're given a chance to compete, we can be the best in the world,\" said Clinton, who was introduced by an assembly worker who spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Monday night.The United States has struggled to bring down its trade deficit with other exporting countries but managed to reduce it to $8.1 billion in June, which analysts said was surprisingly fast. Large trade gaps with China and Japan persist, however.Clinton called the global market \"a tough thing to operate in\" but said he feels good about what has been happening since he began insisting that \"if we were going to have free trade, it has to be fair.\"\"You know, just four years ago this plant exported 17,500 Cherokees. This year, 41,500. That means 700 more good middle-class jobs and strong families,\" he said.He later boarded his \"21st Century Express\" for the third day of his four-day whistlestop train tour as he makes his way through five states on his way to the Democratic Convention, where on Thursday night he will accept the party's nomination for a second four-year term.Churning into the battleground state of Michigan, Clinton was to announce in the blue-collar factory town of Wyandotte the latest in a series of policy intiatives aimed at generating some enthusiasm as he makes his way to Chicago.He is to propose a $2.5 billion programme to launch a national literacy campaign for American children.His plan, as outlined by a senior White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity, is to hire reading specialists and place them at 20,000 sites across the country to establish after-school programmes to ensure that children by the third grade, or about age eight, are able to read independently.\"The overall goal is to raise standards for the 21st century by making reading a basic goal for every young person,\" the official said.The plan would cost $2.5 billion over five years, and would be paid for by cuts elsewhere in the national budget, including an elimination of some corporate subsidies.About $1 billion of the total would expand Clinton's national service programme, Americorps, to help create a pool of reading specialists. Republicans fought hard last year to kill Americorps but failed.The senior official said currently about 6 million children, or about 40 percent of American third-graders, cannot read independently.", "label": ["C21", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Greek Premier Costas Simitis is set to call early elections this week aiming to focus more closely on European economic and monetary union with a new mandate, officials said on Wednesday.Financial markets have welcomed the elections talk.\"It is better to hold elections now rather than later because political cost will weigh less in economic and foreign affairs decision-making,\" said Panos Panayiotopoulos, chief money market dealer at private Alpha Credit Bank.\"The reaction of the markets has been positive so far judging from the behaviour of the stock market, the drachma and interbank rates,\" he added.He forecast a fall in interest rates based on a receding political risk premium. Markets were bound to discount a fall in inflation and an improvement in the budget deficit.The Athens bourse climbed 2.3 percent on Tuesday when the hint of elections came from the government. Trading resumed firmer on Wednesday with stocks gaining a further 0.96 percent.A cabinet meeting scheduled for Friday was moved up to Thursday when Simitis was expected to make the official announcement for early polls.Officials said the prime minister could choose to make the announcement on Friday after a joint meeting of his PASOK socialist party parliamentary group and central committee.The constitution requires that polls must be held within a month after they are announced and the most probable dates are September 22 or 29. Elections are now scheduled for October next year.\"The market prefers a compressed pre-election period rather than a prolonged one, as planning in the public and private sectors will not have to deal with a short 12-month horizon but look longer term,\" said broker Dimitris Paparistidis at Kappa Securities.A decision to go to the polls early would end a period of uncertainty that has led Athens's battered bourse to very low levels. The benchmark index had turned south, below 900 points, with a negative year-to-date performance.\"The run-up in equities is starting from very low levels. Couple this with improved macroeconomic indicators as we get closer to the implementation phase of key infrastructure projects and you have three reasons for the rise,\" Paparistidis said.This echoes well with other market watchers as well. Senior dealers at foreign banks are bullish on early elections since a renewed mandate will make it easier for the government to take tough economic measures.Simitis and his Finance Minister Alexandros Papadopoulos are in the final stages of putting together next year's budget which includes cuts of $1.2 billion in state spending and the restructuring of public companies to boost growth.\"I think elections is the best solution. It will help clear up the political front ahead of tough economic decision making,\" said fund manager Alexandros Sarrigeorgiou at Allianz Mutual Funds.\"What is the most positive is the fact that it is the first time that no matter which party wins the elections in Greece, it will be a one-way street in terms of economic policy,\" he added.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Theoretically we could destroy all the material in the second set of pits or find a third site. The material will be destroyed one way or the other.\"A routine NATO patrol discovered an estimated 400 tonnes of small arms ammunition, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines in a schoolhouse in Margetici, near Sokolac, on August 5.Because the Margetici site had not been declared to NATO as required under the terms of the Dayton peace agreement, troops confiscated the material and prepared to destroy it in an operation codenamed \"Volcano\".NATO engineers dug two sets of blast-pits in a remote area near Margetici to contain the exploding munitions in lots of a few tonnes each.Altogether 24 tonnes of munitions were destroyed on Monday and another 24 tonnes on Tuesday.On Monday the Serbs complained that blasts from one set of pits might contaminate water resources in the area.Blasting continued in the other set while NATO engineers considered the Serb complaint.The Mayor of Sokolac saw NATO officers in Margetici on Tuesday to renew complaints about the water table, and about broken windows in his town.He said the damage included windows in the Orthodox church, although windows much closer to the blast site were not damaged on Monday or Tuesday.But the commander of NATO land forces in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Walker, was willing to hear more about the water table impact. \"We are taking the issue seriously indeed,\" Walker told reporters in Margetici.\"We've done quite alot of what I might call superficial geological examination and it seems to us the claim that it could do damage to the water table is probably not correct.\"Walker said if there were any chance of environmental damage NATO would not use the suspect set of pits.Operation Volcano is expected to continue for the rest of the week.", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Israeli security forces ransacked a Bedouin encampment in the West Bank on Monday to expel them from an area which Palestinians say had been earmarked for Jewish settlement expansion, residents said.They said soldiers demolished shacks and animal barns, overturned water containers and dumped their food on the ground.They also charged that soldiers stole a gold necklace, a pair of earrings and about $2,000 in Israeli currency from an elderly woman and her daughter-in-law while searching their luggage before knocking down their family shacks.\"They rammed our shacks with jeeps and destroyed one shack over my baby,\" said 25-year-old Amina Muhammad, pointing to a pile of corrugated tin sheets. \"He was saved only by a miracle.\"A Palestinian expert on settlements, Khalil al-Tafakji, said the raid was part of Israeli army efforts to clear Bedouins from wilderness close to Arab East Jerusalem to expand Jewish settlements in the area.But a spokesman for the Israeli civil administration, Peter Lerner, said the army wanted to move the Bedouins because they were camping in an area close to a firing range.Lerner said he knew nothing about soldiers stealing from the Palestinians.Israeli security forces have frequently pursued Bedouins living in the desolate wilderness between East Jerusalem and the Dead Sea, where several Jewish settlements have been established since the early 1980s.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently overturned a four-year freeze on settlement expansion imposed by the government of Shimon Peres whom he ousted in May elections.Palestinians, who view settlements as an obstacle to peace, were enraged by the move.Hundreds of landless Bedouin families, many expelled from southern Palestine when the Jewish state was set up in 1948, live in tents or tin shacks in small encampments scattered across the barren wilderness. They survive by raising sheep or working in construction on Jewish settlements.Other Bedouins remained in Israel where they are now citizens. Many serve in Israel's army.Um Salem al-Hadhalin, surrounded by her frightened grandchildren, said the soldiers, armed with clubs and guns, surprised her while making tea for breakfast.She said they cut down tent ropes and knocked down animal barns either by ramming them with jeeps or by pulling them down with ropes tied to their vehicles. She said the soldiers confiscated two tents.Um Salem said the soldiers went through her family's luggage piece by piece, dumping everything on the dirt floor.\"They kept telling us that we must move.

{"token": "Smaller-than-expected summer cash withdrawals from banks pushed the central bank's reserve money aggregate below its target in July, a senior National Bank of Poland (NBP) official said on Tuesday.Earlier today, the NBP said July's average daily reserve money level, the bank's operational monetary policy target, was at 31.861 billion zlotys, against the 32.4-33.1 billion target.\"Demand for cash in circulation fell in July due to seasonal factors and did not correspond with estimates done on 1995 basis,\" Jacek Osinski, deputy head of monetary policy and credit department, told Reuters.He said cash in circulation, which makes up about 70 percent of reserve money, failed to grow as quickly as forecasted because cold and rainy weather in July kept many would-be holiday makers at home and curbed demand for cash.Cash in circulation inched up by 0.6 percent in July to 22.49 billion zlotys after growing by 2.3 percent in June.However, for a large part of the month cash in circulation was actually declining and, because reserve money is calculated using a daily average, July's average level fell, Osinski said.The central bank has missed its monthly reserve money target only twice since the start of the year by exceeding it in March and falling below the set goal in July.The NBP sets the monthly reserve money level as its operational goal for this year through which it wants to control money supply and, consequently, price growth.Reserve money, also referred as high-powered money or monetary base, comprises cash in circulation, cash in vaults and bank's obligatory reserves.-- Krzysztof Wojcik +48 22 653 9700", "label": ["E12", "E51", "E513", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "A special immune system protein that scientists thought offered hope for treating the HIV virus that causes AIDS may in fact make the infection worse, researchers said on Wednesday.Beta-chemokines, proteins secreted by immune system cells to communicate with other cells, actually seem to help the HIV virus infect one type of immune system cell, Michael Bukrinsky and colleagues at the Picower Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, New York, said.Reporting in the science journal Nature, they said other researchers should think twice before developing chemokines as a therapy against AIDS.Scientists became excited about chemokines when they found some of the small percentage of people naturally resistant to HIV infection produced a lot of them in their blood.Further research showed that when the HIV virus infects immune system cells, it uses some of the same cell receptors -- which resemble cellular doorways -- as beta-chemokines.Therefore, they thought, chemokines might be able to \"block the door\" against the virus.Other tests showed that the presence of chemokines seemed to block infection of T-cells, one of the class of immune system cells that HIV attacks. And last month scientists found about one percent of people of European origin had a genetic mutation affecting one of these cell receptors.But Bukrinsky said he had found that beta-chemokines helped the virus infect macrophages -- the cells that engulf and destroy invaders such as bacteria.\"In sharp contrast to their observed antiviral effects in T-cells, beta-chemokines actually stimulate the replication of primary HIV strains in macrophages, another target of this virus,\" Bukrinsky's group wrote.They said they thought the beta-chemokines might be secreted by immune system cells as a \"defensive manoeuvre\".\"We want to warn against using chemokines as a therapeutic agent. That could be very dangerous,\" Bukrinsky said in a telephone interview.He said scientists still did not know how many cell receptors were involved in HIV infection. The virus, he said, could use many different doors to break into a cell -- and could use different doors for different types of cells.This could mean a different cell receptor was involved when HIV infects macrophages.He also said the study that showed people resistant to HIV had higher levels of chemokines involved experiments in test-tubes -- not on a living person.\"I don't buy that even if they have high levels of chemokines that has anything to do with control of HIV infection,\" he said in a telephone interview.He said a better route to controlling HIV would be to manipulate the receptors known to be used by the virus in some other way.", "label": ["GCAT", "GHEA", "GSCI"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Colston resigned as a Labor party senator to complete his present term, which ends in 1999, as an independent in the Senate.Labor opposition Senate leader John Faulkner said he was disappointed Colston had not made his loyalties to the Labor party clear.\"It is very disappointing that he did not mention the Labor party as Mal Colston has been a Labor party senator since the mid-1970's,\" Faulkner told Australian Broadcasting Corp Radio.  \"He was endorsed as a labor party senator ... and as far as I'm concerned he has a primary loyalty to the Australian Labor Party,\" Faulkner said.But Colston had indicated to a senior Labor member earlier on Tuesday that he would support the Labor party on the key policy issues in parliament, Faulkner said.\"It remains to be seen how he will vote, but I am sure all those people that cast a ballot for the Labor party in the Senate in Queensland and elected Mal Colston will demand that level of loyalty from Mal Colston,\" Faulkner said.  Queensland Labor party state secretary Mike Kaiser said in a statement on Tuesday that he understood Colston had resigned because the federal Labor party had chosen someone else for the position of Deputy President of the Senate.In a fax to Kaiser, Colston said he had resigned because of significant differences between himself and other members of the federal Labor party.\"There is no doubt in my mind that Senator Colston's decision to resign was designed to put a loaded gun to Labor's head, but the Party was not prepared to give in to blackmail,\" Kaiser said.  Colston's resignation from the Labor party means he is no longer bound by party policy and can decide his own position on legislation.The Labor opposition and minor parties hold the balance of power in the Senate and have pledged to block some of the new Liberal-National government's reforms, including the partial privatisation of Telecommunications carrier Telstra Corp.-- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The Zimbabwean government risks missing key economic targets in its 1996/97 budget, depending on how it finances a 20 percent wage rise it awarded to striking civil servants, economic analysts said on Thursday.The government of President Robert Mugabe said on Thursday that in order to try to end a nine-day strike which has crippled essential social services it would give civil servants the increase of 20 percent in addition to a recent nine percent award.It has yet to spell out how it will finance the new increases and also clarify whether it would reverse its decision to fire the strikers, estimated by Public Service Associaiton (PSA) officials at 70 to 80 percent of the country's 180,000 public servants.The strikers -- including doctors, nurses, mortuary attendants and firefighters -- took to the streets on August 20 demanding wage increases of between 30 and 60 percent, saying their salaries had failed to keep up with high rates of inflation.The analysts said the new awards would add between Z$1.3 billion (U.S.$129 million) and Z$1.5 billion (U.S.$148.5 million) to the government's wage bill which was pegged at Z$8.6 billion (U.S.$851 million) in the 1996/97 fiscal year ending June 30.\"The effects on the financial situation of the government could be very severe indeed, but it all hinges on how it is going to finance the extra expenditure,\" economic consultant Eric Bloch told Reuters.\"If it does it by increased deficit it will have a negative effect on economic recovery and will refuel inflation which was on a downward trend,\" he said.Zimbabwe's annual inflation has fallen to 22 percent in July from 28 percent in January, largely because of a drop in food prices. The central Reserve Bank forecast it at 20 percent in December with a further slide to 16 percent by next June, sparking hopes of lower interest rates.Anthony Hawkins, a professor of business studies at the University of Zimbabwe, forecast the budget deficit at over 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), missing the target of 8.5 percent forecast for the year, unless the government introduced new taxes or cut expenditure elsewhere to finance the increases.\"It looks like that target (8.5 percent) is out of the window without increases in taxes or expenditure cuts elsewhere,\" Hawkins said.Some government officials estimated the new pay rise would push the budget deficit to between 10 and 12 percent of GDP.\"If there are further increases then the figure will be even higher,\" one official who declined to be named said. Government officials would not comment on where the money would come from.Bloch warned that if the government decided to raise taxes to raise additional revenue it would discourage investment and would slow economic recovery, which has been led by the rebound of the important agricultural sector after drought.\"The practical and realistic approach would be to cut other expenditure or speed up government's disinvestment programme from parastatals,\" Bloch said.\"I would hope that its commitment to the public that it will contain the deficit, and pressures from international donors...to cut expenditure will make it follow that path because if they don't, we risk losing future funding for reforms.\"Last year, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund withheld crucial aid for Zimbabwe's economic reforms after it failed to meet some cost-saving targets.----Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 27/8/9---", "label": ["C42", "CCAT", "E211", "E21", "E41", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GJOB"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Australia's current account deficit might have stabilised over the past few months, easing market fears of a return to spiralling debt, but problems still remain, economists said on Thursday.The current account deficit for July was A$1.28 billion, (US$1.02 billion), slightly up on June's A$1.22 billion, but well below the 1996 high of A$2.12 billion in May, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday.The deficit came in right at market expectations and had little impact.Analysts said that after moderating from record highs in mid-1995, the deficit has receded as a market concern, except when it appears to be rising, for example in April and May.\"This is another good monthly number,\" Bankers Trust Australia chief economist Chris Caton said. \"We've had two good numbers in a row ... this is now a neutral number for markets.\"Adding to the favourable atmosphere was news that the trade balance was in surplus for the second month in a row, the first time this has happened since early 1994, despite a 3.8 percent fall in exports.Treasurer Peter Costello welcomed the July result, saying the deficit was heading in the right direction, and using it to support the cuts he announced in last week's budget.\"It's heading in the right direction and we think it's important that we lock in a lower current account deficit by boosting domestic savings, and that's what our budget strategy's all about,\" Costello told reporters.Economists backed Costello, but were more cautious as to whether further improvement would be seen, saying cyclical gains in areas such as trade were smoothing over continuing long-term structural problems, especially in the net income deficit.\"While it (the July deficit) is a pretty reasonable sort of number, the structure of it is still not looking all that pretty with the net income deficit just being so big,\" Citibank Australia senior economist Stephen Koukoulas said.\"And that's probably going to take three to five years to really correct even if you have all the right policy settings in place,\" Koukoulas said.The net income deficit is the main component of the current account account deficit and it has been larger than the total deficit for four of the first seven months of 1996. In July, the net income deficit was A$1.74 billion.The net income deficit represents the difference between income earned offshore and income paid offshore -- essentially it is the cost of funding Australia's external liabilities.Improving the net income deficit is not a short-term task, and economists said the measures announced by Costello in last week's budget would not produce results for a number of years -- and in the meantime the net income deficit would prevent further substantial improvement in the current account deficit.Commonwealth Bank chief economist Bruce Freeland described the July current account figure as \"pretty good news and basically I think about as good as Australia's current account can be expected to be at the moment\".\"The big constraint remains the A$1.7 billion per month on our net income deficit. That's not going to change in a hurry, that really does put a floor under the current account,\" he said. (A$1 = US$0.79)", "label": ["E511", "E51", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Peace seemed closer in battered Chechnya as Russian and separatist commanders implemented a truce and President Boris Yeltsin finally gave his public blessing to talks aimed at a political solution.The two sides said they plan to start pulling back forces in the heavily damaged capital Grozny on Saturday and form joint military patrols to enforce the new ceasefire.The truce came into effect at noon (0800 GMT) on Friday, rekindling hopes for an end to the 20-month-old separatist conflict only days after some of the heaviest fighting.Russian security chief Alexander Lebed pressed on with his peace plan armed at last with Yeltsin's public approval.Itar-Tass news agency reported that Lebed briefed Yeltsin by telephone on Friday in Moscow and the president gave the former paratroop general the go-ahead to seek a political solution in talks with leaders of the Chechen separatist guerrillas.Lebed, who got sweeping powers as Yeltsin's special adviser in the breakaway republic, had signed the military agreement with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov.Now he is drafting the broader political agreement and was expected to return to the region this weekend.Military leaders on Friday held a relaxed meeting in southern Chechnya and declared they were in total agreement.\"Today we were unanimous. We discussed all the problems, all the questions which we had...from tomorrow we will start putting things into practice,\" the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, said after the meeting.\"We are absolutely sure we are on the right path.\"Maskhadov said Russia's clear decision to stop the war had made all the difference.\"It is difficult to talk to each other when you don't know if they want to end the war,\" the rebel chieftain told reporters after sitting down with Tikhomirov for talks filmed by Russian television.The peace breakthough came after Russian troops had threatened to flatten the Chechen capital Grozny, most of which the rebels captured on August 6.The truce appeared to take hold, although scattered exchanges of fire indicated there were still those on both sides reluctant to stop fighting.Yeltsin's approval removed major uncertainty from Lebed's initiative. The president had seemed to be avoiding meeting his envoy, leaving Lebed's authority doubtful and the Kremlin chain of command unclear.Yeltsin's backing had been seen as crucial for Lebed, a novice in Kremlin intrigue who has said he expects strong resistance to a deal some in Moscow might consider a national humiliation.The Russian president still seems no nearer to conceding full autonomy to the Chechens. His press service said he had empowered Lebed to hold talks aimed at an accord defining Chechnya as an integral part of the Russian Federation.Yeltsin has said he wants peace but rejects full independence. Lebed has said in the past he has no objection to Chechen secession if the region's one million people want it.Russian public television said that Russian forces would leave Grozny between Saturday and Wednesday and that rebel units would also withdraw.Russian and rebel commanders in Shatoi, about 50 km (30 miles) south of the capital, told Reuter journalist Dmitry Kuznets a Russian division would withdraw on Saturday, the start of a larger Russian pullout from the region.The two commanders said they would meet again on Saturday.Maskhadov said the idea was for the military to take control of the situation and not allow any provocations on either side.He and Tikhomirov appeared confident that this ceasefire, unlike previous ones, would develop into an end to the conflict.But Tikhomirov said that they had to be wary of the mysterious \"third force\" which had crushed all previous attempts to reach peace.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "A Chinese appeals court, in a rare move, sharply reduced on Friday to five years a prison sentence for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee accused of corruption.The court's decision followed a brief suspension of technical assistance by the IMF and a Beijing visit by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus to voice concern over what he described as judicial shortcomings in the case.The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court sentenced Hong Yang, 44, a Chinese national, to five years in prison for accepting bribes totalling 100,000 yuan ($12,000) in 1993, before he joined the IMF, the Xinhua news agency said.\"The sentence was dealt with leniently... and according to law,\" Xinhua quoting the court as saying on Friday.Hong, a former employee of the People's Bank of China, or central bank, was arrested in December while on an IMF mission to China. He was found guilty on June 28.Beijing sources said the original sentence was for 10 years, although statements by the IMF in Washington put it at 11 years. Hong appealed.Chinese courts rarely cut sentences on appeal, though an admission of guilt may lead to more lenient treatment.Camdessus has confirmed reports that Chinese authorities pressured the IMF to include Hong, who had been working at the international organisation's headquarters in Washington, on a mission to China.The Chinese actions created a furore at the IMF and Camdessus said in a letter to the organisation's staff he would closely monitor a second trial.\"I also urged that the second open trial be transparent and complete and remedy the shortcomings of the first trial,\" Camdessus said after he visited Beijing last month.Xinhua did not mention the original trial but it highlighted the legality and openness of the second.It said the case was put on open trial on August 9 and that Hong, his two defence lawyers and four witnesses appeared in court and were involved in the proceedings.It also said that 200 people, including Hong's relatives and IMF officials, were present.It added that the man accused of offering the bribe, Fan Honggen, and other individuals from the Agricultural Bank would be dealt with in a separate case.

But our p/e ratios are now lower than they have been since 1993 -- some are so low that you can't expect much more of a de-rating.\"The Johannesburg Stock Exchange industrial index is currently sitting with a p/e ratio of about 15, from 18.5 at the start of the year. But analysts say many foreigners want to see it down a couple more points before they return.Despite buying 9.5 billion rands worth of equity stocks since March 1995, when the financial rand was scrapped, foreigners are seen straddling the fence until South Africa proves itself economically and the rand stabilises.\"You have to look at the overall sentiment. At the moment what is undermining our market has been the unstable rand, and nobody is sure where it is going,\" said David Shapiro, chief dealer for Frankel Pollak.\"People are starting to lose confidence in the ANC's (African National Congress) ability to really turn the economy around.

Half-year attributable income slid to 427 million rand from 471 million previously.Another heavyweight to post poor results was Impala Platinum Holdings whose gamble on currency hedging, plus a furnace failure, knocked its year attributable income to 176 million rand from 281 million in the previous year.In addition to dismal performances already reported, a number of companies have issued profit warnings ahead of their results announcements.Shares in pulp and paper producer Sappi Ltd fell last week when it warned that second half earnings would get no benefit from improved markets and would be below the first half.In May Iscor Ltd  ISCO.J also warned that profits would decline in the second half of the year.However, some analysts keep faith that the market will turn around by the end of the year or mid-1997.\"We're a little wounded at the moment.

It's coming down to paying hefty premiums to consolidate.\"The announcement said the deal will be structured as a \"cash election\" merger for Boatmen's shareholders, meaning they will have the right to receive either stock or cash.The transaction will be a tax-free exchange for Boatmen's shareholders to the extent they receive shares of NationsBank, the companies said.They added that at least 60 percent of the purchase price paid to all holders will be in NationsBank common stock. The balance will be paid in either cash or NationsBank stock, or a mix of the two.NationsBank said it expected to realise $335 million in annual cost savings from the merger by 1999. This represents a reduction in the combined expenses of 5 percent, it said.The merger is subject to the approval of both companies' shareholders and the appropriate regulatory authorities.", "label": ["C181", "C18", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Micheal Casey, economist at MFR Inc, said it would take major news to force the long bond yield outside ot its 6.75- to 7.25 percent range and the revision of the second-quarter gross domestic product won't be it.\"It's deadly boring news,\" Casey said of the GDP revision, scheduled for release on Thursday at 1230 GMT.The market consensus is not looking for much change either in the growth rate that was first reported at 4.2 percent.\"The long bond is firmly in a range between 6-3/4 percent and 7-1/4 percent.

With much of Italy's growth still export-based, the slow-down in its European trading partners means that output growth will be substantially lower in 1996 than was seen in 1995.\"  Assigning the long-term local currency rating of AAA to Italy sovereign debt, IBCA said this debt was worth 1,547 trillion lire (or $1,020 billion)IBCA said it noted Italy's considerable strengths as a sovereign credit -- \"illustrated by the continued dynamism of the private sector, the current account surplus and the high savings ratio.\"\"These aspects of the economy have allowed Italy to sustain high public debt without having to draw on foreign savings,\" it said.  -- Kate Kelland, International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 8682", "label": ["C17", "C174", "CCAT", "E212", "E21", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "For five years, the guns have lain silent in the vast Western Sahara. But failure to find a political answer to the territory's future -- made clear in a report sent to the Security Council -- now threatens even the ceasefire that ended some 17 years of war.Morocco claims the former Spanish colony of more than 250,000 square km (over 100,000 sq miles) and which has huge phosphate mines and rich Atlantic fishing grounds.Its claim is disputed by the Polisario Front which seeks independence for the people there, and the man-in-the-middle -- the United Nations -- is trying to hold a referendum to decide on its future.Efforts to identify voters have, however, collapsed and in a report to the Security Council last week, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said:\"Given the current situations of the two parties, it is unlikely that the identification process will be resumed any time soon.\"He appealed to the two sides to show flexibility -- which each has accused the other of demonstrably lacking.Finding some solace, Boutros-Ghali said: \"I should like to express my satisfaction that the ceasefire is holding.\"But patience is wearing thin in the Polisario ranks. Last month, Front leader Mohamed Abdelaziz threatened to resume war unless the U.N. implemented the deadlocked peace plan.\"If it turns out that the Security Council and the secretary-general fail to assume their responsibilities and fail to enforce observance of the U.N. peace plan in the Moroccan part of Western Sahara, then the only course of action that remains for Saharans is to resume the fight to defend their right to self-determination and independence,\" he said.Earlier the same month, King Hassan said Morocco would remain in the Western Sahara with or without a U.N. referendum.Registration operations of potential voters were suspended in December 1995 after persistent disagreements between Morocco and the Front, over who should be eligible.Polisario, formed in 1973 with Algeria's backing, accuses Morocco of trying to pack the electoral rolls with supporters having only tenous links with the territory, whose inhabitant include many nomads.The Saharan population is concentrated in four main towns, including the capital Laayoun with more than 100,000 people. Tens of thousands more are based in camps in Tindouf, south western Algeria, waiting for the referendum.In recent weeks, Erik Jensen, chairman of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), has toured Algiers, Nouakchott, Rabat and Tindouf in a new attempt to resolve the dilemma of voters lists.But U.N. officials have already closed nine registration offices in the Western Sahara because of the impasse.\"Polisario is the main obstacle which hinders the follow-up and achievement of the identification process...we want all people of Saharan origin to vote in the referendum and nobody should be excluded,\" a Moroccan official said.Morocco has had an estimated 100,000 troops in the region, of which it controls four-fifths. Sand walls have made much of it impregnable and its air force controls the skies.But the Polisario has a political weapon in its Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). If militarily it faces overwhelming odds, recognition of the SADR, which the front says comes from over 70 countries, is an embarrassment to Rabat.Earlier this year South Africa's President Nelson Mandela showed he wanted formally to recognise the republic.\"Morocco has invested more than $3.0 billion in (Western) Sahara infrastructure to upgrade its economy...Military expenses for the defence of the territory are not included in this amount,\" a former Moroccan finance minister said.Meanwhile, according to the International Red Cross, about 2,000 Moroccan servicemen languish as prisoners of the Polisario, awaiting a political solution which the U.N. Security Council is to try to look for this week.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIP", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Currently, such trading is only possible with first tier stocks.\"In the long-term, when the market starts to recover, these changes could be good,\" said Yoo Tae-hou, managing director of the Daewoo Research Institute.\"But in the short term it doesn't solve anything, because the problems we're having right now are caused by more fundamental economic issues, such as the trade deficit and rising interest rates.\"Investors reacted coolly and the stock market closed down 9.49 points at 779.63, the lowest close since November 10, 1993, when it fell to 777.89.According to the new rules, companies seeking to go public must show a return on paid-in capital of more than 50 percent over three years, up from the current 30 percent.They must also have an asset value of more than 15,000 won ($18.30) per share, double the present 7,500 won, and earnings per share of more than 10,000 won, against 5,000 won now.Currently, there are quarterly quotas on IPOs. Because the qualifications are so low, there is a long queue of companies seeking to go public, and a temptation to cheat.This month the former head of the Securities Supervisory Board was convicted of accepting bribes for helping companies to list and sentenced to a five-year suspended jail term.Under the new regulations, companies qualified to list may do so without waiting for the official nod. This means less chance for corruption, analysts said.\"At least no one's pockets will be lined along the way,\" said Andrew Holland, head of research at BZW Securities in Seoul, referring to the new regulations.The new rules impose limits on new issues by affiliates of the top-10 business groups. Annual capital increases for these firms will be held to four percent of total outstanding value of company stock or 100 billion won, whichever is larger.The aim is to prevent them from dominating the market for new issues and allow smaller companies to flourish.\"The economy has a definite imbalance between the cash-rich chaebol and smaller companies that go bust, and anything that tries to alleviate that is good,\" said Philip Smiley, manager of the Seoul branch of Jardine Fleming Securities.\"But the higher requirements for offerings will still make it difficult for smaller companies to access cheap funding, so it's not a magic wand to cure the problem.\" ($1 = 819 won)", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "M11", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

EDT (2100 GMT), and was to feature a tribute to Ron Brown, the commerce secretary and former party chairman killed earlier this year in a Balkan plane crash, and an appearance by actor Christopher Reeve, star of the Superman movies who was paralyzed in a horse riding accident.Also picked to speak were gun control advocate Sarah Brady, whose husband was shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981.The convention ends on Thursday when the 50-year-old Clinton formally accepts the nomination to run against his Republican challenger, 73-year-old Bob Dole of Kansas.Throughout the week convention organizers planned to present a portrait of \"real people\" and fresh faces, highlighting the problems and worries of average citizens. Party leaders said it would be a message designed to connect solidly with middle class families, the largely white suburb dwellers most likely to vote and who may hold the key to who controls the White House for the rest of the century.Clinton chugged toward the convention city on a slow train stopping from town to town to campaign through the vote-rich Midwest. But he was on a fast track in some of the polls.A CNN poll of registered voters gave Clinton a 12-point lead over Dole -- a boost of seven points from a week ago when the Republicans presented a polished new face at their San Diego convention and hammered away at Clinton's trustworthiness while trumpeting their plan for a 15 percent income tax cut.An ABC poll of likely voters showed Clinton leading Dole 47 to 42 percent, with Texas billionaire Ross Perot's third party effort trailing at 7 percent.Dole was spending the convention week resting at Santa Barbara, California, but planned a number of announcements during the week to keep his name in the news.In Portland, Oregon, Sunday evening he rejoined running mate Jack Kemp and pressed his attack on Clinton, saying the president had engineered a \"rapid response\" to Dole's own speeches but lacked a rapid response on drug abuse or a host of other problems facing the country.Clinton's train trip took him on Monday to Ohio, a key swing state in the November election, where he called for a ban on selling handguns to people convicted of domestic violence.Saying he strongly believed in the right for most Americans to own guns, Clinton said \"those who threaten the safety of others\" like wife-beaters and child abusers \"do not deserve our trust.\"In the coming days, Clinton planned to highlight other issues which he believed where he had strong public support. Before arriving in Chicago on Wednesday Clinton planned major announcements on education and the environment.On Sunday he criticized Dole's tax cut proposal, saying it would \"blow a hole\" in the budget and bankrupt social programs.In a CNN interview on Sunday evening he angrily blasted Republicans for hounding many of his staff and associates  over the Whitewater affair.\"I think it is outrageous that these middle class people have had their lives wrecked by pure, naked raw politics,\" Clinton said angrily.While Clinton rode the rails, the 4,329 convention delegates partied. State delegation parties and receptions were spread across the third largest U.S. city in museums, restaurants, railroad stations and historic sites.The Democrats have a hard act to follow after Republicans produced a slick, well-orchestrated display of unity and harmony at their San Diego convention -- and they are battling a last summer wave of weariness among television viewers who clicked their ways to other programs or found other pursuits in massive numbers during the Republican event.The Chicago gathering is the first held in the city by either major party in 28 years. When Democrats last met here in 1968 both the party and the city were ripped apart by dissent over the Vietnam War as police bashed the demonstrators.Hubert Humphrey left the city that year with a damaged nomination as a result and lost the election that year to Richard Nixon.But some of the anger persists. CNN on Monday morning interviewed peace activist David Dellinger, who was at the heart of the street protests in 1968, along with a former Chicago policeman, who told the network he would still rather not be standing anywhere near Dellinger 28 years later.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Ronald Sandler, chief executive of Lloyd's of London, on Tuesday underwent a second day of court interrogation about the 300-year-old insurance market's multibillion-dollar recovery plan, which he defended as critical to Lloyd's solvency.Sandler was questioned for four hours in a federal courtroom by lawyers for American investors in Lloyd's and by U.S. District Judge Robert Payne about Lloyd's complex restructuring plan to settle large losses.Tens of thousands of investors in Lloyd's worldwide -- quaintly known as Names -- were anxiously awaiting the outcome of the case, in which 100 U.S. investors have applied for an injunction to block the recovery plan.Under the rescue proposal, Lloyd's was to reinsure billions of dollars in liabilities, including pollution and asbestosis-related claims in the United States, in a new company called Equitas.The proposal also includes a 3.2 billion pound ($4.95 billion) cash offer to the Names designed to offset the cost of Equitas. The investors must vote on the plan by Aug. 28.The suit, which names 93 plaintiffs, seeks to block the plan until more detailed financial information is released. It contends that Lloyd's has breached U.S. disclosure laws.Sandler, as he did on Monday, said the plan was crucial to Lloyd's solvency.Payne questioned Sandler for about an hour, asking about Lloyd's plans to pay its liabilities and what would happen if its investments made more money than was needed to pay off those liabilities.\"Most (Lloyd's officials) believe that some time over 30 years the liability will be extinguished,\" Sandler said, adding that any money left over would go to charities.When asked by the judge who the benefactors would be, Sandler said he was not able to answer.Payne told Sandler firmly that the company needed to have a plan for the disposition of leftover assets and that he would need to be told who the benefactors would be.Payne also asked whether Lloyd's was able to pay the total premium if U.S. investors did not back the recovery plan. Sandler again said he was unable to answer.The proceedings resumed in the afternoon after a break for lunch.Payne earlier criticised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to determine whether Lloyd's should be subject to U.S. securities laws.The legal challenge was complicated on Friday by the SEC's neutral position on this issue. Payne said the SEC would have a second opportunity to respond to his request for a ruling.Separately Tuesday morning, Lloyd's received a boost from another court case in New York, which dismissed action brought against the market by four Names.They had claimed that Lloyd's knew long ago the extent of liabilities faced by Names.\"We are pleased by this decision. Names entered into their commitments under U.K. law and we are pleased that U.S. courts continue to recognise this,\" said Lloyd's U.S. executive, Peter Lane.", "label": ["C11", "C13", "C17", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Beef imports of about 500,000 tonnes a year will be needed, the attache said, and pork imports of 350,000 tonnes this year.Pork imports could climb to 400,000 tonnes in 1997.Russian beef production was projected to fall seven percent this year, continuing the trend that started with free market reforms in 1991, the report said.Overall, demand for meat in Russia totals about 8 million tonnes but production was about 5.5 million tonnes in 1995, the attache wrote. The gap would be filled by poultry, meat imports and a shift to fish and other meat substitutes.  \"Meat imports into Russia should rise for the next several years,\" the report said.Russia and the United States recently resolved a dispute over poultry sales that jeopardized trade for several months. Russia is the No 1 market for U.S. poultry exports.Russian beef imports were a record 370,000 tonnes in 1994 and 450,000 tonnes in 1995.\"In the near term, the outlook for beef production in Russia is not promising,\" the attache said. \"A turnaround in the industry should not be expected any time soon.\"  Beef and pork production in Russia is inefficient by world standards, the attache said.In the past five years, pork has become the most expensive meat in Russia. In June, average pork prices were 15-20 percent higher than beef and 25-30 percent higher than poultry.Pork imports totaled 210,000 tonnes in 1994 and 310,000 tonnes in 1995.The attache estimated Russia's cattle inventory at 43.3 million head in 1995, 39.7 million at the start of this year and 36.5 million at the start of next year.  Pork inventory was pegged at 15.6 million head in 1995, 14.4 million at the start of this year and 13.3 million at the start of 1997.A related report released by the department said during the first six months of this year, Russia imported $212.25 million in frozen poultry, $249.5 million of frozen beef and $108 million in frozen pork.", "label": ["C311", "C31", "C312", "CCAT", "E51", "E512", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Iraq has been under stringent U.N. trade sanctions since its troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990.The U.S. official said there was \"photographic evidence at oil loading facilities in Iraq, details of interdictions by the force and the results of discussions or interviews with the captains and masters of those vessels in which a number of them admit they loaded oil in Iraq but purchased documentation from Iranian officials.\"He said the Iraqis \"in their desperation to sell oil\" were dumping the gasoil as low as $15 a metric ton for ships willing to come into Iraq and load.The Iranians, he said, often extracted as much as $55 per metric ton in protection fees. \"It leaves still, if the world price fluctuates between $180 and $200 per metric ton, a pretty substantial profit for a ship's captain who is willing to undertake this kind of voyage.\"The official said there was a pattern of Iraqi attempts at shipping oil out in large tankers in 1992-1994, but the work of the multinational naval task force stifled that activity.However, starting late in 1995, the officials said, Iraq resorted to shipping oil products out on tugs with barges and other small ships, trying to avoid notice of the task force.

{"token": "As America Online Inc. continues to dominate the online service business and new rivals jump into Internet access, competitors like CompuServe Corp. are under more pressure as they try to adapt to the changes.This week, CompuServe reported a $29.6 million loss for its fiscal first quarter and a decline in subscribers, which it had predicted last month. But the online service also said its losses will carry into the second quarter, raising some eyebrows on Wall Street.\"In online services, there is AOL (America Online) and everyone else,\" said Adam Schoenfeld, a vice president at Jupiter Communications.\"They (CompuServe) made a strategic decision to abandon their profitable model and they are trying to compete head-to-head with AOL and they are now paying a price for that,\" Schoenfeld said.CompuServe said its losses were due to the decline in subscribers, incremental costs for its Wow! service aimed at novice users, the new version of its flagship CompuServe Information Service, 3.0, and improvements in its network.CompuServe is moving its closed, proprietary service to the lower-cost, open architecture of the Internet, but its investment in the new framework comes at a bad time, a few months after its initial public offering.CompuServe, once a subsidiary of tax preparer H&R Block Inc., went public in April at an initial offering price of $30 a share. Its stock closed at $11.875 Wednesday after dropping $1.625 following the first-quarter report. The stock was 12.5 cents higher at $12 Thursday on Nasdaq.H&R Block retained an 80 percent stake in CompuServe after spinning it off, but is selling that holding.Even though America Online still dominates the market, it also has had its share of problems recently. Two weeks ago, it suffered a severe embarrassment when its network went down for 19 hours. It also started a new pricing plan to compete with encroaching Internet access providers.America Online has more than 6 million subscribers to CompuServe's 5.2 million, which includes members of NiftyServe, a joint venture in Japan and the CompuServe Information Service's more than 3 million members.Some analysts, however, still forecast that, even with AOL's recent problems, the company will still likely reach its target of 10 million subscribers by next year.\"AOL's still growing and CompuServe is not, that's a problem,\" said Abhishek Gami, of Nesbitt Burns Securities in Chicago. \"AOL will continue to be the market share leader for the proprietary service (model), and the plain-vanilla ISPs (Internet service providers offering Net access only) will continue to take share from AOL.\"Analysts said telecommunications giants like AT&T Corp., MCI Communications Corp. and most recently Sprint Corp. will make major inroads in the Internet access market with their huge customer base.\"Everyone is trying to cover their bets and provide access and content. Ultimately, I think those guys will have their niche,\" said Doug Rutherford, an industry analyst with Zona Research in Redwood City, Calif. \"Why wouldn't you go with AT&T, MCI, or Sprint, if it's all on the same bill. If you are getting a dial tone, do you care who your phone company is?\"Emily Green, an analyst at Forrester Research, has long been predicting a shift away from online service providers in favour of direct Internet access providers as they also change.\"I still think AOL is going to plateau next year,\" Green said, adding that she did not see members reaching 10 million.She said she still believed fervently that in the long term the Internet service providers will take a lot of business away from online services and that ultimately the Internet providers will look a lot like online services.In Europe, Europe Online's demise earlier this week was partly due to its untimely decision to follow the proprietary model just before the Internet exploded.CompuServe and the struggling Prodigy service are moving to become Web-based. Analysts say that strategy makes sense from an economical standpoint because they get away from managing a costly, proprietary network, to one based on the Internet.But the move is risky. So far, analysts who have seen an early version of Prodigy on the Web are not that impressed.", "label": ["C151", "C15", "C31", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Fujitsu Ltd, suffering from recession in the computer memory chip market, said it would withdraw from static random-access memory business, an area where Japanese makers are losing out to Taiwanese rivals.The big electronics maker will focus on large-volume chip business, which will generate larger profits but require continuous investments of more than $1.5 billion every few years to maintain market position.Fujitsu, which is moving rapidly to semiconductors and other volume-product business away from computer mainframes, will focus its chip investment on dynamic random-access memory (DRAMs) and flash memory, a Fujitsu spokeswoman said.\"We will be more selective in our investment,\" she said.SRAM chips are used in computers for coordinating speeds and other functions between the microprocessor brain of a computer, and DRAM memory chips used to store information.A large number of DRAMs are required to run sophisticated software on a personal computer, but only one or two SRAM chips are used in each PC.According to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, global SRAM production amounted to $6.07 billion in 1995 -- a fraction of DRAM production of $40.83 billion.Industry analysts said prices of some SRAM chips crashed this year, declining to a level one-10th of that late last year and mirroring a recent slump in the DRAM market.\"Japanese makers cannot make profits in the SRAM business any more. Taiwanese makers can produce them at much lower costs,\" said an analyst, who asked not to be identified. \"Japanese firms are forced to be more selective in investment at this difficult time.\"Fujitsu will close one of the semiconductor production lines at its plant in Iwate, northern Japan, which produces SRAM chips as well as erasable programmable read-only memories (EPROM) and mask ROM chips by the end of March 1997, the spokeswoman said.It does not make these types of semiconductors at its other plants.Flash memory, an emerging read-only-memory chip, is increasingly used in such products as hand-held devices and computer memory cards due to their ability to retain data even after the power is turned off.Fujitsu, along with its partner Advanced Micro Devices Inc, claims the second-biggest share in the global flash memory market.Japanese semiconductor makers, which so far have stuck to aggressive investment policy in the DRAM business, may hold off investments next year due to a plunge in DRAM prices, analysts said.The price of a 16-megabit DRAM chip fell to around 1,200 yen ($11) recently from 5,000 yen ($46) last December as a slowdown in global PC sales caused a sharp DRAM supply glut.Fujitsu recently decided to put off construction of new DRAM facilities in Oregon in the United States and Durham in Britain due to this revision in its output plans.

{"token": "By Gail Appleson, Law CorrespondentThe tobacco industry's troubles deepened Wednesday with the White House expected to endorse strict new regulations on cigarettes on Friday and jury deliberations about to start in a key smoking case.The timing of the White House announcement could hardly be worse for the industry, which is still reeling from a surprise $750,000 damage award earlier this month.Meanwhile, Michigan became the 13th state to sue the industry Wednesday, and on Thursday an Indiana jury is to start weighing whether cigarette makers can be held liable for a smoker's addiction that allegedly led to his death.Tobacco stocks were already tumbling Wednesday on concerns about the Indiana trial when White House officials said they expected President Bill Clinton to accept the new regulations from the Food and Drug Administration on Friday.The rules were expected to be similar to those the FDA proposed about a year ago. Those included barring cigarette billboard advertising near schools and playgrounds and eliminating mail-order sales, vending machines, free samples, self-service displays and sales of fewer than 20 cigarettes.The tobacco industry has sued, challenging the FDA's legal authority to regulate tobacco.Closing arguments were set to begin Thursday morning at the Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis.The jury, which is expected to start deliberations in the afternoon, will be the first panel to decide a smoker's wrongful death case since the surprise verdict by a jury in Jacksonville, Fla., on Aug. 9.If the industry loses the case it will strengthen the view among plaintiffs' lawyers and jury consultants that jurors' attitudes are changing and that panellists are more willing to hold cigarette companies liable for a smoker's addiction.\"If the plaintiffs win (the Indiapolis case) the tobacco companies are really in the soup,\" said Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor who chairs the Tobacco Products Liability Project in Boston.The stock of Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the world's largest cigarette maker, tumbled $3.875 to $87.625 on the New York Stock Exchange and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., the owner of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, fell $1.375 to $25.25.Other tobacco company stocks also fell, and the drop helped pull the entire stock market lower, analysts said.Although the uncertainty from the trial was hurting stocks, the Indianapolis jury, unlike the Florida panel, was not shown certain inflammatory internal tobacco documents.Jury consultants said the documents, which concern the tobacco industry's knowledge of nicotine and addiction, angered the Florida jury. The papers convinced panellists that tobacco companies try to keep smokers hooked and that smoking was not a matter of individual choice, consultants said.The tobacco industry maintains that nicotine is not addictive and denies that it manipulates the level of nicotine to keep smokers hooked.Personal injury lawyers have not been overly optimistic about the Indianapolis case because the documents were not allowed in as evidence. The case involves Richard Rogers, an Indianapolis lawyer who died of lung cancer in 1987. Rogers, who was 52 when he died, began smoking as a young child by stealing his father's cigarette butts.When the case first went to trial last year, the jury was split 5-1 on whether Rogers \"voluntarily\" incurred a known risk by smoking.\"Heads, we win and it becomes a smashing victory. Tails we lose and nobody thought we would win all of these cases,\" said Daynard of the Tobacco Products Liability Project.A loss in the jury case without admission of the key documents could have severe implications for an industry that is facing mounting legal attacks across the country.Since Monday, Kansas, Arizona and Michigan have joined 10 other states that have filed lawsuits aimed at forcing tobacco companies to pay for Medicaid costs of smokers. Oklahoma is expected to file a similar case on Thursday that will bring the number of states to 14 by the end of the week.New Jersey also plans to file a Medicaid suit in the near future and several other states including Hawaii, Utah and Arkansas are also seriously interested.There are also more than 200 cases brought on behalf of individuals in the state of Florida alone and a growing number of class actions including a second-hand smoking case involving flight attendants set to go to trial next year.", "label": ["C12", "C13", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM", "GHEA"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

This showed a July deficit of 506 million pounds ($788.8 million), half of the June shortfall of 1.09 billion ($1.67 billion).Economists said the figures probably made it slightly less likely that Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, the nation's finance minister, would cut official interest rates again next month.Clarke has cut rates four times since December to their present 5.75 percent level.", "label": ["E51", "E512", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Singapore's latest industrial data showed a reduction in petroleum output in June as refiners cut production to try to improve profits on basic refining operations.Refiners said on Wednesday the fall was expected to persist for the rest of the third quarter as they had no plans to raise production until profit margins improved significantly.June output was down three percent from May and second quarter output averaged 1.4 percent lower than the first quarter, figures released by the Economic Development Board (EDB) on Tuesday showed.Refiners said the data came as no surprise in the wake of lower production rates after basic refinery processing operations started showing losses in early June.\"We started lowering our crude runs sometime in June and July when margins turned negative,\" one refiner said.Refiners processing Arab Light crude oil were losing about $1.50 per barrel in early June on primary processing, the first and simplest stage of refining crude oil.Refineries make money by selling refined products at higher prices than they pay for crude oil.Primary margins have since moved into the black, giving refiners a profit of about 50 cents a barrel. Profit margins on secondary processing are around $3 per barrel.One refiner said that although profits had returned, refiners were not convinced it would last and they would continue to maintain an average cut of operations of about seven percent.Shell Singapore, the island's largest refiner, has operated a 200,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) crude distillation unit (CDU) at 80 percent capacity since early August. The same unit was shut in July for a scheduled month-long maintenance.Mobil Oil has reduced operations by 10,000 bpd to 270,000 bpd since mid-June, while Esso Singapore has maintained a 15 percent cut in runs at its 230,000 bpd refinery since early July.Most refiners say they expect profits to pick up once Iraq begins selling its crude oil some time in the fourth quarter, which is expected to undermine crude prices.One refiner said: \"Product prices are relatively high but margins are still bad due to the high costs of crude.\"Demand for petroleum in the third quarter is relatively strong, especially for diesel and jet/kerosene. This has translated into firmer prices so far but not profits because the crude feedstock has remained expensive too.Refiners said improvements to processing margins are more likely to come from a cut in crude prices rather than further increases to petroleum product prices.Singapore's petroleum sector output was up 7.2 percent In June compared to a year ago. Similarly, this year's second quarter output was 13.5 percent more than last year.Refining sources said the increase was due to the addition of a 60,000 bpd CDU at its 230,000 bpd refinery last August by the Singapore Refining Co (SRC).The addition of SRC's CDU, Singapore's newest CDU for six years, raised the island's total capacity to 1.235 million bpd.SRC is a joint venture between British Petroleum, Singapore Petroleum Co, and Caltex, itself a joint venture between U.S. majors Texaco Inc and Chevron Corp.", "label": ["C21", "C24", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Two years on from the first democratic elections, Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) is attempting an economic policy U-turn, bringing it into conflict with old allies on the Left.Gone is the language of the liberation struggle, with its talk of redistribution and nationalisation. Instead, the ANC is singing the benefits of budget cuts and privatisation.Critics talk of a Thatcherite sell-out.But ANC pragmatists argue South Africa has no choice if it wants to boost economic growth and cut crippling unemployment afflicting one third of the workforce.Finance Minister Trevor Manuel laid down the new economic gospel in June -- and insists he will not be blown off course.\"We've got to concentrate on ensuring that we can implement a programme that will evolve a different kind of economy in this country, one that absorbs labour, creates employment, deals with these issues differently,\" he said earlier this month.His macroeconomic strategy sets clear targets for the next five years. The aim is to double economic growth to six percent and create 400,000 new jobs a year by the year 2000, while cutting the budget deficit from more than five percent of GDP this year to four percent next and three percent in 1999.But trade union leaders have condemned the policy, which runs counter to their own demands for greater state involvement.\"There is no way the government will succeed in simply pushing its framework down our throats,\" said Zwelinzima Vavi, assistant general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu).\"It is the entire framework which we wish to discuss. We are not simply seeking the amendment of minor details here and there, but a complete reassessment of their view of the role of the state in stimulating reconstruction and development.\"Cosatu is a key partner, together with the South African Communist Party, in the triple alliance which swept Mandela to office -- and its tough words have triggered fears of a damaging clash.The big showdown with the unions could well come over privatisation.After months of dithering, during which privatisation was euphemistically labelled \"restructuring state assets\", Mandela has finally laid down the law, declaring:\"Privatisation is the fundamental policy of the ANC and it is going to be implemented.\"The prize for the government is great. Economists estimate it could, in theory, raise as much as 100 billion rand ($22 billion) from selling state concerns -- enough to cut government debt by a third.It is already looking for a foreign partner to take a 25-30 percent chunk of telecommunications group Telkom, and recently appointed Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank to advise on other privatisation options.Other candidates include South African Airways, the state airports company, government oil companies, a forestry business -- and possibly electricity generator Eskom.The plans to sell the family silver have set alarm bells ringing among union members, who fear job cuts, triggering protest marches and strikes. Together with a rash of industrial action in the mines in recent months, analysts say this has only underscored South Africa's reputation for labour unrest.Cosatu denies it has a blanket opposition to privatisation, but insists government must keep control of essential services.\"We must look at what are the proposals on the table. Are those proposals saying the government must move out of the provision of the basic services and out of the productive sector? If that is the proposal, we will reject it,\" said general secretary Sam Shilowa.Big business, meanwhile, formerly at odds with the ANC, suddenly finds itself on the same side.Trevor Manuel and his macroeconomic strategy are the toast of Johannesburg board rooms. Instead of worrying about government policy, business leaders' concern nowadays is rather whether government has the political clout to implement it.\"If (the ANC's) political allies are seen to be delaying or in any way undermining what the government has committed itself to in terms of its economic programme, then quite clearly there will be consequences,\" said South African Chamber of Business director general Raymond Parsons.\"Foreign markets and foreign investors, as well as South African investors, are watching the implementation of the macroeconomic strategy with great intensity.\"Foreign investment is crucial to the new economic strategy.Without it, South Africa will not build the new industry needed to drive growth, create jobs and give the unemployed a viable alternative to a life of crime.So far, foreign firms have been slow to put their money into South African bricks and mortar.And the recent pummelling of the rand on the foreign exchange markets suggests overseas investors still need to be persuaded that government will deliver on its economic promises.($1 = 4.56 rand)", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

If past practice is followed, any decision should be announced around 2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT).Martin's forecast was shared unanimously by the 30 economists polled last week by Reuters, although some of those experts did not rule out a rate rise later this year.Financial markets marked time Tuesday morning as they awaited the outcome of the central bank meeting, with bond and stock prices little changed.The Fed meeting takes place at a time when questions abound about whether the economy is beginning to cool off after growing at a fast clip in the second quarter.Until just a few weeks ago, many economists believed the economy was growing quickly enough to require an interest-rate rise by the Fed to slow it down and prevent inflation. However, a series of recent reports containing early signs of a slowdown changed those views.The latest came on Tuesday, with news that the U.S. trade deficit fell by more than 20 percent in June as imports plunged. Analysts said the steep drop in imports pointed to slackening domestic demand and a slowing U.S. economy.\"We had data very recently showing the housing market is starting to fade and the inflation reports were good,\" said Joel Prakken, chairman at the St. Louis forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisors LLC.\"All of that suggests we are seeing a slowdown from the second quarter and that the Fed does not need to move,\" he added.Some experts, however, said the economic signs were inconclusive and did not rule out a rate rise later this year.Any rate increase would represent a reversal in the Fed's monetary policy. The previous rate change was in January, the last of a series of credit easings undertaken when the economy appeared soft. The economy has rebounded strongly since then.The federal funds rate, which commercial banks charge each other for overnight cash, is now at 5.25 percent. The funds rate is controlled by the Fed and acts as a benchmark for other short-term interest rates.The discount rate, which the Fed charges member banks for loans, stands at 5 percent.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

He said Morrison Knudsen's core business remains strong and the problems that lead to the company's financial troubles and its June 25 filing of a \"prepackaged\" Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization were related to the company's entering the business of building railcars, which it has exited.Under the plan, shareholders in Morrison Knudsen will receive warrants, to purchase a total of about five percent of stock in the newly merged firm at $12.00 a share for 6-1/2 years.  They also will be eligible to purchase rights exchangable for certain Morrison Knudsen debt under a July amendment to the plan.

{"token": "The Russian Security Council said on Tuesday that it doubted the authenticity of President Boris Yeltsin's latest orders on Chechnya.\"The contents of the documents give solid grounds to doubt that the president of Russia took a direct part in finalising the text of the order,\" said a statement by the policy-making Security Council.Yeltsin has ordered Alexander Lebed, the secretary of the Security Council and his personal representative in Chechnya, to restore Russian control over the regional capital Grozny, much of which was seized by separatist rebels on August 6.Yeltsin's press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said on Monday that the Kremlin leader had issued the order on Sunday.But the Security Council's statement argued that Lebed was not aware of the preparation of the orders -- which violated normal procedures.The statement also said Yeltsin's orders were issued with a facsimile of the president's signature rather than signed by the president in person.\"The secretary of the Security Council assumes that no one is allowed to manipulate on behalf of the President and insists on explanations from the appropriate officials,\" it said.It said an attempt to carry out the order on Chechnya would ruin peace efforts undertaken by Lebed and wreck a ceasefire deal he agreed with the separatist leaders.\"This would mean in fact the beginning of a large-scale military operation involving aviation and artillery, which would naturally lead to heavy losses among federal troops, massive deaths among the civilian population...and a justified burst of resentment in the country,\" the statement said.Lebed and rebel leaders agreed last week to arrange a truce to allow peace negotiations to resume in a region wracked by conflict which has cost tens of thousands of lives in 20 months.The truce had been generally observed by both sides despite the lack of a clear deal between the sides and mutual recriminations over ceasefire violations.On Monday Russia's top commander in Chechnya, Konstantin Pulikovsky, gave the rebels 48 hours to leave Grozny or face bombing.Yeltsin, 65, has disappeared from the public eye since late June, except for a brief appearance at his inauguration on August 9, but his aides say his health is all right despite exhaustion caused by his vigorous re-election campaign.Yastrzhembsky said on Tuesday that Yeltsin had begun a two-day break in northwestern Russia, denying rumours that the Kremlin leader was ill.He said Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin were continuing to work on the formation of the new Russian government, most of which was announced last week.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Nazi-hunters in Germany let former SS captain Erich Priebke slip through their fingers more than 20 years ago in a bungled a war crimes investigation, a German prosecutor said on Friday.Prosecutor Hermann Weissing told Reuters by telephone that investigators had enough evidence at the time to convict Priebke, now 83, but failed to evaluate it properly.\"Glaring mistakes were made and there were -- what I regard as -- inexplicable blunders in the investigation,\" Weissing, who is in charge of the archive department of a special Nazi crimes unit at the Federal Prosecutors' Office in Dortmund, said.After eight years of inaction, the investigation was shelved in 1971, Weissing, who was speaking from his office, said.In Rome on August 1 this year, an Italian military tribunal found Priebke guilty of \"multiple murder\" for his part in the massacre of 335 men and boys in the Ardeatine caves near Rome in 1944 -- the worst atrocity committed in Italy in World War Two.But it said it could not punish him because a 30-year statute of limitations on murder in Italy had run out. It also, in setting him free, cited mitigating circumstance because of his clean post-war record and and it did not accept that he acted with \"premeditation and cruelty\".His release prompted outraged protests in Italy and abroad.German justice officials then vowed to bring Priebke to justice and the German government is pressing for his extradition to Germany, where there is no statute of limitations on murder. It will be Germany's second try to bring him to book.Weissing said that \"nothing had been been done to find Erich Priebke\" from 1963 to 1971 during an official German investigation into the former SS captain.The television documentary programme \"Panorama\" broadcast on ARD German television on Thursday night said the German foreign ministry had confirmed Priebke had lived in Argentina under his real name during that time and since 1952 had renewed his passport regularly at the German consulate there.It also reported that Priebke had travelled as a tourist and had even returned to Germany on several occasions. It said the German police gave him a certificate of good conduct.German Nazi-hunters had enough evidence in Italian documents from the 1948 trial of his SS commander Herbert Kappler in Italy, Weissing said.\"We had Kappler's verdict and other documents but these were never translated and somehow got shelved without being evaulated,\" Weissing said.The Italian court sentenced Kappler to life imprisonment.\"The verdict would have shown that the killings were cruel and as a result would have been regarded as murder and not manslaughter (on Priebke's part),\" Weissing told Reuters.Prosecutors decided that Priebke could only be charged with manslaughter and closed the investigation because the statue of limitations on that crime had run out in German law.Italian authorities rearrested Priebke hours after he was set free this month when Bonn said it would seek his extradition for trial in Germany. Priebke appealed against his rearrest and Italy said it could not extradite him with an appeal pending.Germany issued an arrest warrant for Priebke last year after he admitted taking part in the Ardeatine caves massacre -- the Nazi reprisal for a partisan bomb attack on German soldiers.In Germany he is wanted to face two counts of murder in the two cases where he has admitted to pulling the trigger himself.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

It also commits Cajun to fund its full share of the estimated decommissioning obligation for River Bend by setting aside the sum of $125 million in a decommissioning trust fund, regardless of the option the RUS chooses.RUS may seek a buyer of Cajun's 30 percent interest in River Bend, take title to Cajun's interest in its own name, or relinquish Cajun's interest at no cost to Entergy Gulf States, which owns the other 70 percent.  Under all of these options, Cajun will be released from its unpaid liability for River Bend costs and expenses.The settlement also lets Entergy Gulf States recover all funds previously paid by it into the registry of the court. These funds have been accumulating from payments made by Entergy Gulf States for its share of operations and maintenance expenses associated with its 42 percent share of the Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, coal-fired generating facilities, of which Cajun is the majority owner and operator.Other provisions involve the forgiveness of several hundred million dollars of claims among the parties.

{"token": "U.S. stocks have been shaken from their August slumber by a series of surprisingly strong economic reports that may bring about one of Wall Street's greatest nightmares -- an imminent Fed tightening.Most market players return Tuesday after Monday's U.S. Labor Day holiday to face Friday's pivotal August jobs data.\"It could be an unpleasant wake-up call for the laissez-faire attitude that most fund managers have fallen into during their August vacation mode,\" said Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management.  The Dow industrials slid 45 points or 0.81 percent to 5602 and the S&P 500 lost five to 652 late Friday morning in anemic trading. The long bond slumped 26/32 to yield 7.11 percent after strong Chicago purchasing managers August data and July factory orders.Stocks and bonds were sent tumbling Thursday after news of a surge in July home sales and an unexpectedly sharp upward revision in second-quarter gross domestic product growth to 4.8 percent. The data showed the U.S. economy had entered the second half with a much stronger tailwind than previously expected.  \"The markets have built in a 25 basis point raise (in short-term interest rates) for later this year but they hadn't been looking for one in September,\" said Marshall Acuff, Smith Barney portfolio strategist.He noted that in a presidential election year, the U.S. stock market tends to be steady to higher coming out of the summer and through autumn, but fears of an imminent Fed hike \"could prove to be an obstacle.\"The market may see the more traditional September-October weakness. \"The bottom line is, it'll be a very volatile period,\" Acuff said.  \"September and October are historically not very good months. There's an 82 percent probability for a correction at some point then,\" said Harry Laubscher of Tucker Anthony.Yale Hirsch's 1996 stock trader's almanac says: \"The curse of October 1929 was receding -- then came 1987 and a 602-point Dow loss. Memory of back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, a meltdown in 1987 and Friday the 13th in 1989 could affect bullish spirits in upcoming Octobers.\"The looming third-quarter corporate earnings season is another area for Wall Street to navigate, with the usual smattering of earnings warnings starting in two weeks.  Mid-July's dismal second-quarter earnings or warnings of shortfalls from such notable companies like Hewlett-Packard Co, Motorola Inc and United Healthcare Corp helped trigger fierce selling that clipped 10 percent off the Dow and 20 percent off the Nasdaq Composite.The market subsequently regained most of its lost ground as overall second-quarter results turned out better than expected. Year-over-year second-quarter operating earnings for the Standard & Poor's 500 companies surged 10.1 percent, beating the early-June 7.1 percent forecast rise, said Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call.  \"I don't think people are as optimistic about third quarter earnings\" as they were for the second quarter, said Laubscher, a market analyst at Tucker Anthony.First Call's Hill said Wall Street expects S&P 500 operating earnings to rise 7.1 percent in the third quarter and Russell 2000 earnings are seen rising 16 percent.Prudential Securities' director of small cap research Claudia Mott agreed smaller caps would likely outperform large caps although she thought the First Call estimates may be overly bullish. \"The economy is growing fairly well. Smaller companies can take that to the bottom line faster.\"  Mott noted larger cap company earnings might be more negatively impacted by foreign sales and stiffer currency translations.Smith Barney's Acuff said the good news for Wall Street is that industry analysts can now be more confident of their earnings projections if the economy proves to be stronger than expected for the third quarter.As for next Friday's jobs report, analysts expect 238,000 jobs to have been created in August and the unemployment rate is forecast at 5.3 percent.  Bond analysts said Treasury prices would tumble if the employment report shows jobs growth in excess of 300,000 and an uptick in hourly earnings.The Federal Reserve's next policy-setting committee meeting is set for September 24.Analysts said money flows into equity mutual funds remains another key factor for Wall Street.\"The supply/demand balance for equities had been, and continues to be, the real story of the market this year and September may be critical. AMG data suggests that domestic equity mutual fund flows may be stabilizing though at a much lower rate,\" said UBS Securities market strategist Gail Dudack.\"The four-week average weekly rate is now $2.7 billion after falling to $1.5 billion a month ago.

{"token": "Romania's President Ion Iliescu, in power since the 1989 fall of communism, prepared on Wednesday to launch a campaign for another term in November polls amid opposition charges his candidacy is unconstitutional.Aides say Iliescu, 66, will try to project a new image as a Western-orientated statesman who can steer a safe course for his country through painful reforms needed to put the Balkan state on a free market footing.Supporters from his leftist ruling Party of Social Democracy (PDSR) will gather in a communist-era palace in southern Bucharest to hear their candidate announce his platform for presidential and parliamentary polls on November 3.Iliescu, a former communist functionary who swept to power by ousting dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania's violent 1989 revolution, is still the country's strongest political player and the PDSR's trump card, analysts say.Opinion polls show him leading rivals, but suggest the presidency will only be decided in a second-round vote.Iliescu will have to fight opposition accusations he wants to cling to power at all costs and will further slow reforms, as well as nationalist charges he has sold out to the West.Opposition leaders say Iliescu's candidacy breaks constitutional rules limiting presidents to two terms and have vowed to challenge him in the courts. Iliescu argues his first term, from 1990 to 1992, predates the current constitution.His campaign will be managed by a posse of diplomats, led by the ambassador to Switzerland, with Iliescu seen distancing himself from unpopular elements in the PDSR which is tarnished by corruption scandals.Wednesday's ceremony will project Iliescu as a national father figure and set the tone for a hard-fought campaign, expected to abound in political muck-raking, despite pledges from politicians they will remain well-mannered.\"The campaign will be gentlemanly, because we will be heavily scrutinised from abroad,\" his campaign spokesman, Mircea Ioan Pascu said on Wednesday. Electioneering officially starts on September 4.Iliescu's main rivals are Emil Constantinescu, an academic standing for the opposition Democratic Convention bloc, and Romania's first post-communist premier, Petre Roman.Polls give Iliescu a lead of 36 percent, against 28 percent for Constantinescu and 21 for Roman in the presidential race.Managers of his party, which fared poorly at local elections earlier this year, hope that Iliescu's popularity will buoy the PDSR's chances at the November ballot, just as it he did in the last election in 1992.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The government has 280 seats in the 550-seat parliament.The scheme was instituted in 1988 to boost investment, but union leaders and other critics say it has been widely abused and offered little in the way of returns.Analysts have said the fund abolition is likely to be welcomed by workers who will see an immediate benefit to their wage packets and employers, whose wage costs will fall.But they say it will not be of any positive benefit to the economy as the government still has to make payments to workers and will have to consider alternative savings measures.Since the scheme was set up, workers have paid two percent of their salaries and employers contributed a further three percent. The government has not provided figures on the size of the fund.The abolition of the savings scheme, the latest in a series of populist moves by the Islamist-led coalition, will take effect in the month after it is published in the Official Gazette, Anatolian said.In earlier populist moves, civil servants have been given a larger-than-expected wage rise and the minimum wage was doubled, raising concerns about the government's commitment to rein in Turkey's gaping deficits.Annual inflation in Turkey is running at over 80 percent and the 1996 budget deficit is expected to total 1,300 trillion lira ($15 billion).($1 = 86,000 lira)", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GPOL", "GWELF"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

In Britain's \"House of Horrors\" case it was set off by underground holes which were found to contain bodies.On Friday evening exhausted police suspended their searches until Monday.In two weeks of hunting police have discovered the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of another of Dutroux's houses in Sars-La-Buissiere near Charleroi.They have rescued two other sexually abused girls -- Laetitia Delhez and Sabine Dardenne -- from a dungeon in the Marcinelle house and are searching for at least two others -- An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks -- whom Dutroux admits kidnapping.The Jumet house was formerly occupied by Frenchman Bernard Weinstein, an accomplice who Dutroux admits murdering. His body was found next to those of Julie and Melissa.South of Charleroi in the town of Neufchateau, the nerve centre of the investigations, magistrates confirmed the charges of vehicle theft, insurance fraud and forgery against chief police detective Georges Zicot.Charges were also confirmed against two other men arrested with Zicot on Sunday in connection with the car theft ring uncovered by police investigating Dutroux' paedophile sex gang. A fourth man, Pierre Rochow, was released.Dutroux has been linked to organised vehicle theft and police are investigating the child sex and theft ring together.Belgian radio said police would travel to Bratislava and Prague to search for missing Belgian children.Dutroux has been named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman. Interpol's Slovak office has said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one other Slovak woman.A spokesman for the Belgian gendarmerie's special disappearances squad said they were also likely to contact colleagues in Austria investigating what seemed to be a \"child-for-hire\" network spread across central Europe.Dutroux has said Julie and Melissa, who he admits paying Weinstein and associate Michel Lelievre 40,000 francs ($1,300) to abduct in June 1995, starved to death early this year while he was in jail for car theft.Belgian newspapers said Dutroux's second wife Michelle Martin -- also under arrest -- had admitted that she failed to feed the children out of fear of facing them in their cell.Nine people are now under arrest in the affair including Martin who has been charged as an accomplice. Dutroux and Lelievre are charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Another similar air expeditionary exercise to Qatar just ended.\"There is contingency planning, but we're not ruling anything in and we're not ruling anything out,\" said one Pentagon official. \"No decisions have been made.\"The official said the United States already had 21 ships, including the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, and 200 aircraft in the region, operated by more than 20,000 military personnel.The aircraft carrier Enterprise had been in the eastern Mediterranean for exercises for the past several weeks, and one official said there were no plans to move the carrier.CNN also reported that two B-52 bombers were being moved to Guam, about halfway between the United States and the Gulf. The Defense Department had no comment on the report.At the State Department, spokesman John Dinger said late on Friday, \"We are keeping close watch on the situation in the north of Iraq and we would take any aggressive Iraqi moves in the area very seriously.\"On Thursday, Iraq accused Iran of military aggression and said it reserved the right to retaliate for Tehran's alleged deployment of troops into Kurdish-populated regions of northern Iraq.Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, in a statement carried by official newspapers, accused Tehran of sending troops to northern Iraq and said Baghdad \"preserved the full right to retaliate.\"The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Massoud Barzani has said that Iran sent troops and military equipment into northern Iraq in support of the guerrillas of its rival, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), led by Jalal Talabani.A cease-fire between the warring Kurdish factions took effect on Wednesday, and the State Department has said it appears to be holding.

{"token": "The foreign exchange options market was largely skeptical that a pick-up in demand for dollar/yen options this week could be signalling an end to the dreaded August doldrums, dealers said.Implied volatilities, which had plunged to lowest levels in recent memory last week after a month of stagnant spot trading, have rebounded in the past few days, but traders said the market could be setting itself up for a disappointment.\"I don't know if they are a convincing buy,\" said Ted Voorhees, a senior trader at Deutsche Bank in New York.  \"We could see pockets of movement, where the market gets excited...and then spot just sits,\" he noted. \"Activity in the spot market will be very choppy and very off-and-on, which makes it difficult to be long a lot of options.\"The bounce in volatilities this week was most pronounced in the shorter maturities and low-deltas as traders awaited the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) \"tankan\" quarterly business survey due out Wednesday.One-month implied volatility for dollar/yen stood at 7.0/7.2 percent in Tuesday's U.S. trading, compared with Monday's 6.85/7.05 and Friday's 6.6/6.9.  But traders said that if tankan failed to show surprisingly enough strength in Japan's economy to fan fears of higher yen interest rates and thus a dollar decline, option buyers were likely to retreat to the trenches.In that case, the long weekend coming up for the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday would not help.\"If it (a big move in the dollar) doesn't happen by tomorrow, I have a feeling the weekend is going to start Wednesday afternoon,\" said Alan Revercomb, options strategist at I.D.E.A. Inc. The dollar hovered in narrow ranges slightly below 108 yen for most of the day.  Still, the surge in dollar/yen volatilities this week startled many interbank traders who had been constantly selling shorter dated options in the past several weeks to offset the time-decay risk for their long positions in back-end options.\"I think a lot of dealers have accumulated short positions (in strike prices) below the market,\" Revercomb said. \"As we move down, that creates some nervousness.\"Masao Okada, a senior trader at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank in New York, agreed that volatilities had increased their sensitivity to the dollar's downside in the past few days.  He noted that risk reversals, which shows the pricing differential between puts and calls, had increased their skew towards yen calls. One-month 25-delta risk reversal stood at 1.1/1.3 percent at U.S. midsession, compared with 0.85/1.05 on Monday and 0.7/1.0 late last week.\"If the dollar doesn't move very much, it would stay peaceful,\" Okada said. \"But once we get to a point where people can't withstand the down move, we may see some turmoil.\"-- Chicago Derivatives Desk (312) 408-8750E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com", "label": ["M13", "M132", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The idea is to have a common market within 10 years and we hope that will be achieved,'' Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarirahe said.\"It is a real turning point, moving us from talking to action,'' he said.SADC was formed 16 years ago to lessen the region's dependence on then apartheid South AfricaSADC officials said they expected all 12 heads of state at the meeting which follows a two-day meeting of SADC regional ministers which begins on Wednesday.-- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003", "label": ["E512", "E51", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "A $655 million revaluation of the Electricity Corporation's assets announced today will not be a driver in future power price rises, ECNZ chief financial officer Arun Amarsi told NZPA on Thursday.The revaluation, which will lift the corporation's value to $3.3 billion, was disclosed in a commentary on the company by international ratings agency Moody's Investor Services.ECNZ is currently tendering long-term power supply contracts with average reserve prices rising at 1.18 percent annually.Mr Amarsi said that although those reserve prices figured in the sales assumptions underlying the valuation, they were not a big driver.\"There are no price rise implications in that (valuation),\" he said.Amarsi said the revaluation, based on discounted future cashflows, was the first since 1987-88 and was really a catch-up to the company's existing cash-flows.By increasing the value of the business, the Government's percentage returns on its equity would fall to a more reasonable level, he said.ECNZ said it was likely to pay a special dividend to the Government in March as a result of the revaluation.Amarsi declined to estimate the size of that dividend saying it was a board decision that would depend on the level of interest-bearing debt the company was carrying.Moody's said the Government was likely to use a high dividend payout ratio and special one-off dividends to maintain a debt-to-total-capitalisation ratio of 40 percent.  ECNZ expects to fund a $200 million, four-year upgrade of its Manapouri power station from retained earnings and existing credit lines, but Amarsi said the board might yet want to consider further capital expenditure.ECNZ was split in two in February, with Contact Energy acquiring the other $1.6 billion in assets.Contact Energy communications manager Bruce Thompson said the company was also revaluing its assets, but not for credit-rating purposes.  Having received the power stations at book value, Contact considered a revaluation \"prudent\" and expected to publish those details in its first annual report.Although the value of Contact's Clyde and Roxburgh hydro stations were likely to have increased, one industry observer said a downward valuation was possible for Contact.It had a greater exposure to more expensive thermal generation and some of those stations were operating below installed capacity, he said.\"Don't assume that it would revalue up,\" he said.  In June Contact announced staff cuts at its thermal plants and in July announced plans to spend about $350 million building a new gas-fired power station at either Otahuhu or New Plymouth.-- Wellington newsroom 64 4 4734 746", "label": ["C31", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

It had improved its taxi fleet by adding the latest Santana model and diversified into car leasing, house removals and long-distance bus services, it said.The company also continued to develop its real estate business, despite difficult business conditions, achieving post-tax profits of 5.18 million yuan, 51.8 percent of the target for the whole year, the statement said.The firm has also set up an international travel company to expand on its business of domestic tourism, it added.The company has a total of 1,750 taxis, the spokesman said.Some foreign brokers recommend a \"hold\" on the stock.Sasoon Securities said the company was being hit by restrictions by the Shanghai city government on new taxi licences, a drop in the prices of second-hand cars and increasing dependence on income from outside its core taxi business.A second broker warned that such diversification would involve more risks for the company, although he expressed confidence in the company's management to run such ventures successfully.", "label": ["C11", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

When the officials will fly to Nigeria has yet to be determined.\"We want political prisoners to be released and progress on setting up democratic institutions,\" added Axworthy, whose country is in the forefront of those CMAG members who want serious sanctions to be imposed on Nigeria.But Nigeria accuses the Commonwealth of interfering in its internal affairs and CMAG cancelled its August 29/30 fact-finding mission after officials there made it clear the team would not be allowed to meet members of opposition groups.Nigeria's military government on Wednesday insisted discussions with the group should be restricted to the country's suspension from the Commonwealth and the group should not visit as a fact-finding mission.\"CMAG proceeded to seek for an extension of their visit...with a view to holding discussions and meetings outside the framework of our agreement in London. This is not only outside the mandate of the CMAG, but is also in contravention of the agreement reached at the London meeting,\" Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi told diplomats in the capital Abuja.CMAG agreed a set of sanctions against Nigeria in May, including a ban on arms exports and a visa ban on Nigeria's rulers and their families, but agreed to suspend the measures until the New York meeting to allow the two sides to talk.\"If no progress is made on this mission we'll see real fireworks in September,\" said one senior Commonwealth diplomat who asked to remain anonymous.CMAG chairman and Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge said he hoped the Nigerians would accept the visit of senior officials from the Commonwealth secretariat but conceded there was no guarantee they would agree.\"We want the CMAG stay in Nigeria to be as productive as possible in the time available,\" he told a news conference.But Nigeria knows it has little to fear from CMAG sanctions since members are hopelessly split on the idea of imposing an embargo on oil exports, the one move which would cripple the country, since oil provides 90 percent of its export earnings.Britain firmly opposes the idea, saying it would only harm ordinary Nigerians and not the country's rulers. This has strained relations with Canada, which announced in June it would unilaterally impose sanctions on Abuja.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "An overture by China to bring its critics into the team picking Hong Kong's future leadership shows openness but might split the democratic camp in the British colony, analysts said on Tuesday.Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said this month the 400-member body that will choose the chief executive and legislators who will run the territory after its July 1, 1997, transfer to China could include people with divergent views on democracy.His remark at a Beijing meeting was taken in the colony as an olive branch towards Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party, which so far has been excluded from transition arrangements.Although pegged to the acceptance of China's plan for an appointed \"provisional legislature\" to replace the current fully elected council, the remark was in stark contrast to China's harsh invective against the party over the past year.The gesture is also fuelling heated discussion in local political circles and newspaper columns about China's motives.\"It might be an attempt to split the democrats, but more probably Beijing has realised that they've failed to split them so far and it's time to get them on board,\" Hong Kong University political analyst Nihal Jayawickrama told Reuters.\"I'm sure there are elements in the Democratic Party who will feel the urge to respond positively,\" he said.But Democratic Party leader Martin Lee last weekend rejected the idea of joining the Selection Committee, saying that would amount to recognition of an illegitimate body.The party argues that China's plan to scrap the present legislature and appoint a new \"provisional\" one has no basis in law or in the handover treaties with London.\"So long as China insists that any participant must assist in both selection processes -- Hong Kong's future chief executive and the provisional legislature -- I can't see how they can get the democrats on board,\" Jayawickrama said.But he said it was likely the temptation would prove strong for some of Lee's associates and that they would quit the party.China is very eager to give the Selection Committee a greater air of legitimacy by including some democrats, some China analysts in Hong Kong believe.\"At the end of the day, it's a question of who gets into the committee. And I don't think people like Lee or (deputy party leader) Szeto Wah would get in even if they are nominated,\" political commentator Andy Ho told Reuters.The leaders of the party, the biggest in this territory of 6.2 million people, have drawn Beijing's wrath since 1989 when they sided with the student-led, pro-democracy movement that Chinese army tanks crushed in Tiananmen Square.\"We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that China has changed its position towards the Democratic Party,\" Ho said. \"It just wants to create an impression of openness.\"Some of China's Hong Kong advisers differ in their view of Qian's remarks. Tsang Yok-Sing, a pro-Beijing politician, has said he did not see them as an invitation to the democrats.Emily Lau, an outspoken independent democrat who has often riled China's communist rulers, interpreted Qian's comment as a brazen effort to drive a wedge into the democratic movement.Qian had divided the pro-democracy camp into \"people who are prepared to compromise their principles and those who will stand firm\", Lau wrote in a column in the South China Morning Post.\"With the scramble for seats on the Selection Committee having begun in earnest, it will rapidly become clear that some members of the pro-democracy camp are eager for a place...

Whether we have complaints about it or not, it should be in Solidarity Election Action,\" he said.Walesa offered his own team of advisers, the Lech Walesa Institute, to draft a legislative programme for the new AWS.This would include more sweeping privatisation than the current government programme, a new social insurance scheme, a reform of the health service and a measure restricting government interference in the economy.Other reforms he listed concerned local government, the civil service, tax, agriculture, public order and education.Walesa won almost 50 percent of the votes last November but studies showed a section of voters actively disapproved of him -- prompting rivals to say he should avoid direct campaigning.An August opinion poll by the private PBS centre suggested the ruling SLD was backed by 28 percent of voters and the Solidarity alliance 23 percent, while ROP, the UW and the Peasants had 12 percent each.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The sites covered a total area of more than 20 million square metres (215 million square ft), but the government has agreed to protect one tenth of the area due to a lack of funds, it said.Some ancient tombs and relics have already disappeared under the onslaught of bulldozers, the letter said.Construction of the controversial dam was expected to submerge 632 square km (244 square miles) of land in central China's Hubei province and the southwestern province of Sichuan.It would force the relocation of 840,000 people from up to 200 villages and towns, according to 1991-92 estimates.Environmentalists have described the project as a potential ecological disaster, leading to the destruction of a scenic mountain region and the extinction of endangered species.The Three Gorges dam -- the world's biggest water control project --  was expected to ease seasonal flooding by creating a massive reservoir in Hubei to store waters from rains.The 6,000-km (3,500-mile) Yangtze river -- China's longest -- and its tributaries have triggered floods throughout much of China's history.The project, expected to cost $30 billion by its completion in 2009, would also help ease China's crippling shortage of electric power.", "label": ["C24", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GENT", "GENV"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "One man was killed and another wounded in a shootout on Tuesday between security guards and gunmen outside the home of a senior official of Mexico's Attorney General's office, officials said.The gunfight began moments after the wife of Armando Salinas Torre, the private secretary of Attorney General Antonio Lozano, arrived at her home, according to a statement by the Attorney General's office.Officials said it was not clear if the incident was a deliberate attack on Salinas or his family.One assailant, identified as Porfirio Alejandro Jimenez, was wounded in the gun battle and later checked himself in to a public hospital, where he died.A police agent assigned to protect Salinas' wife, who had entered the home safely moments before the shootout, was wounded in the gunfight. He was reported in stable condition at a local hospital, the statement said.\"There was a shootout in front of (Salinas') home just as police agent Adrian Sanchez Montes was closing the garage door, shortly after the wife of Mr. Salinas Torre had entered the home,\" the statement said.\"We are reviewing the evidence.

{"token": "Burma's embattled dissident leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Saturday accused the military government of intensifying its oppression of the democracy movement.Suu Kyi, in a weekend speech to crowds outside her Rangoon home, said democracy supporters were being arrested and intimidated.\"The authorities are stepping up oppression against the supporters of our democratic movement,\" she said. \"Our people are arrested and intimidated.\"Suu Kyi did not refer directly to the recent arrest and sentencing to stiff prison terms of some 30 NLD supporters, including one of her aides, but said the harsher oppression showed that the ruling military was not confident of its position.\"If the authorities are confident of their own position.... they will gain the support of the people without having to arrest them, put them in prison, threaten them,\" she said.Earlier on Saturday, NLD sources in Rangoon said reports of the imprisoning of more NLD supporters were filtering out to colleagues.There were unconfirmed reports from Burma's second city, Mandalay, that 19 more NLD supporters were sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years for allegedly plotting unrest, an NLD source said.Burma never announces sentences imposed on dissidents but last Wednesday said 19 people, including at least two NLD members, had been arrested for plotting unrest.Several days earlier 11 democracy activists, including Suu Kyi's personal assistant Win Htein, were sentenced to seven years' jail for violating security laws, NLD sources said.Suu Kyi was released from six years house arrest in July last year and has since been pressing the military to open talks on political reform.The government has ignored her calls and in May launched a sweeping crackdown against the NLD and stepped up a war of words with Suu Kyi, accusing her of being a lackey of colonialists and a traitor.Burma's army commander, in an obvious reference to Suu Kyi and Western government which support her, urged his forces to help eliminate threats to the nation from both inside and outside the country.General Maung Aye, also a leading member of the ruling miltary body, said in a speech on Friday that powerful nations and \"lackeys\" inside Burma were trying to dominate the country and hinder its development.The millitary has ruled Burma since a 1962 coup. The current governing generals rose to prominence in September 1988 when troops crushed a pro-democracy uprising and a new ruling military council was set up.Suu Kyi, who won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to restore democracy, is the daughter of General Aung San, the country's pre-independence leader and the founder of the modern Burmese army.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "A South Korean court sentenced former president Chun Doo Hwan to death on Monday on charges of masterminding a 1979 coup and an army massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators the following year.Under Korean law, execution is carried out by hanging.His presidential successor, Roh Tae-woo, was sentenced to 22-1/2 years in prison for playing a supporting role.Grim-faced and dressed in blue cotton prison pyjamas, both were also convicted of massive corruption during their tenures that spanned 13 years and ended in 1993.Many Koreans believe current President Kim Young-sam will offer the former generals a pardon.Separately, nine business tycoons -- including the chairmen of Samsung and Daewo -- were sentenced for bribing Roh. All got jail terms but the sentence on the Samsung chairman was suspended, meaning he will not serve time.In all 13 former military colleagues of Chun and Roh were handed jail sentences of four to 10 years in what was dubbed the \"trial of the century\" that dug up many of the dirtiest secrets from South Korea's era of strongman rule.Nine one-time aides bodyguards received jail terms on various charges of bribery, including acting as bagmen for their presidential bosses.The army massacre in the southern city of Kwangju killed about 200 civilians by official count and crushed democratic opposition to Chun's martial law rule.Chun and Roh are expected to appeal against the sentences handed down by the Seoul District Criminal Court.\"I have a heavy heart,\" senior judge Kim Young-il told a news conference after the trial.Yonhap news agency quoted presidential aides as saying it would be absurd to comment on the possibility of amnesty before the cases were reviewed by higher courts.The investigation against Chun and Roh turned Korean business and politics upside down and was spurred by president Kim's campaign to \"right the wrongs of history\".Women relatives of the Kwangju victims, dressed in traditional mourning white, attacked Roh's son, Jae-hun, as he left the court and shouted \"Kill the murderer's son\".Earlier they cheered news of the death sentence, but some burst into tears when they heard Roh had escaped death.The three-judge panel said Roh was spared in recognition of his role in gaining South Korea entry into the United Nations in 1991 and other diplomatic achievements.Chun was fined 225.9 billion won ($276 million) and Roh 283.8 billion won, equal to the amount they were convicted of illegally pocketing. Roh had confessed to amassing a 500 billion won slush fund while in office. Chun was accused of building a secret 700 billion won fortune.Chun's rise to power came \"through illegal means which inflicted enormous damage on the people\", according to the judges' verdict.Referring to the massacre, they accused the defendants of \"putting down popular resistance to clear the way for their rise to power\".Chun and Roh remained defiant throughout the trial, defending the coup as necessary to prevent turmoil following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee.Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, who heads South Korea's largest industrial conglomerate, was sentenced to two years in jail suspended for three years.Chairman Kim Woo-choong of Daewoo, a top-four group, was given a two-year jail term without suspension.Also jailed, for 2-1/2 years, was the head of Dong-Ah group, Choi Won-suk, whose company has massive construction projects in the Middle East and Libya.All the businessmen have seven days to appeal during which time they will remain free. Their sentences sent shockwaves through Seoul's corporate boardooms, but analysts said the moguls were unlikely to spend time behind bars.Putting them in jail would be too great a blow for an economy dominated by family-owned conglomerates, some run almost single-handedly by ageing patriarchs, the analysts said.\"I believe the president will pardon them,\" said Dongbang Peregrine's head of research Rhee Namuh. \"They represent too big a part of the economy.\"Ordinary Koreans reacted to the former presidents' sentences a mixture of relief and anger.\"I'm very ashamed to live in this country where a former president is sentenced to death and imprisoned,\" said Lee Jong-im, 37, a housewife and mother of two children. \"I don't know how to teach our children in the future.\"", "label": ["C12", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Two years earlier, only 67 percent were re-employed and 21 percent were unemployed.\"While the decline in job dislocation is a positive trend, the report also confirms that some American workers who lose their jobs remain unemployed and, for those who do find jobs, many experience a drop in earnings,\" said White House economic adviser Joseph Stiglitz.Of the long-term workers who had been displaced from full-time jobs and were re-employed again by February, fewer than half were earning as much as, or more than they did in their previous jobs and one-third earned at least 20 percent less, the report said.Nearly 20 percent of re-employed workers became part-time, self-employed, or unpaid family workers, it said.\"This report underscores the importance of increasing access to education and worker training and protecting dislocated workers' health and pension benefits to help ease job transitiions and reduce the costs of job loss to American workers,\" Stiglitz said.Manufacturing workers made up the largest share of displaced workers with 29 percent and were among the least likely to be re-employed, the report said. The biggest declines in displacement included managerial, professional and skilled craft employees, it said.Those most likely to be re-employed quickly were younger and working as technicians and in related support jobs, while older workers who had been machine operators, assemblers and inspectors were least likely to be re-employed, it said.", "label": ["C42", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GJOB"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The move jolted many market players who had expected a more modest reduction.\"The market had really reined in its expectations to something in the range of a five to 10 basis point adjustment by the Bundesbank,\" said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.  \"To get 30 basis points on the repo was I guess a pleasant surprise for people that were (positioned) the right way,\" Pettit added.After the Bundesbank announced the rate cut, the dollar jumped sharply and continued climbing to 1.4964 marks, its highest level in five weeks. However, the rally ran out of steam as some investors took advantage of the move higher by selling the U.S. currency and booking profits.\"It moved a good strong pfennig,\" said Diego Giurleo, vice president of the Treasury at Royal Bank of Canada. \"They bought the dollar, (but it) lost momentum above 1.4950.\"  Traders noted that there was talk of good dollar offers just above 1.4950 marks, while they saw solid support amid rumors of buying interest just below 1.4900.The dollar closed at 1.4919/26 marks, down from 1.4940/45 at the open. It fell to 108.24/34 yen from 108.70/73.Buba President Hans Tietmeyer said a slowdown in German money supply growth and low inflation had allowed the central bank to cut its main money market rate.Other European central banks also slashed rates on the heels of the German rate cut including banks in France, Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands.  The Swiss National Bank left its discount rate unchanged but pumped liquidity into the Swiss money market to relieve upward pressure on money market rates.While currency traders applauded the repo rate cut on Thursday, concern about where German interest rates are headed from here may have limited early dollar gains against the mark.\"I'm just surprised that it didn't move over 1.50 (marks) because that's a very strong move by the Bundesbank,\" said Tom Benfer, director, foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal.  \"I think the market is now trying to grapple with the notion -- is this the last move of the Bundesbank or could there be further cuts in the future,\" Benfer asked.In other trade, the dollar finished at 1.2074/81 Swiss francs, down slightly from 1.2080/90 at the open.Sterling rose to US$1.5509/17 from US$1.5470/80.The dollar closed at Canadian $1.3690/95, off from C$1.3754/59.The Australian dollar closed at $0.7910/15.-- Donna Sells 212-859-1668", "label": ["M132", "M13", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Imperial Tobacco Group will split from conglomerate Hanson Plc on October 1 as one of the most efficient players in its sector, but while the new chief talks of export-led growth, the outlook is clouded by the threat of litigation against tobacco firms.Imperial is Britain's second biggest tobacco firm after B.A.T Industries and its brands include Embassy, John Player Special and Superkings cigarettes as well as Panama and Castella cigars.It is one of four arms of the mighty Hanson conglomerate being spun off into separate floated companies to unlock value.In the ten years since Hanson took over Imperial, it has slashed costs, cut its brands to 33 from 150 and raised productivity by 195 percent. 1995 profits were 348 million pounds on 3.6 billion of sales.But analysts fear that despite Imperial's impressive track record, marking it as the comeback kid of the tobbaco industry, its shares could face a rough ride once listed in London.This week saw tobacco stocks hit by a backlash in the United States, with fresh litigation plus tough new curbs from U.S. President Bill Clinton to regulate the industry.So far, BAT Industries has borne the brunt. But some analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the U.S. scenario widens its impact and is repeated across the Atlantic.\"If it happens in the U.S. it's subsequently followed in other countries,\" said Zafar Khan, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.\"Imperial could have been a ripe international takeover candidate. But the litigation threat means a group buying a tobacco company would have a tough time selling the idea to shareholders now,\" he said.UBS analysts agree that the threat of legal action is enough to dampen the company's outlook.But they warn of another possible dampener on the stock when Imperial starts trading - its heavy reliance on Britain, largely seen as a mature market. Britain accounts for 87 percent of profits, say analysts.Imperial has already committed itself to overseas expansion, but there are fears that it will have a tough time muscling in on the U.S. giants which have already made inroads into the markets of tomorrow - India, China and the Far East.\"We see investor concerns on litigation risk combined with the uncertain outlook in the key UK market as implying a 20-30 percent PE (price earnings) discount to the UK average.\" This assumes a prospective PE of 9.9 times, UBS said in a note.It has given Hanson a total break-up value of 164 pence, in a market range of 150 to 200 pence per share. Hanson shares were down 2 1/2 pence at 159 1/2 by 1033 GMT Friday.UBS specifically values the Imperial constituent at 39 pence per share or 2.03 billion pounds ($3.14 billion).However, another investment analyst who declined to be named, said he was more upbeat on Imperial's prospects.\"It's a clean business. It could become a takeover target and it's also very cash generative,\" he said.He values Imperial at 37 pence in a total Hanson break-up valuation of 187 pence per share.There is some upside to the Imperial story. Apart from being viewed as a highly efficient player and being the second biggest UK tobacco company with 38 percent of the market, it is also poised to try and tap the vast emerging markets.Gareth Davis (corrects from Nigel Davis), Imperial's chief executive who joined the company straight from university, told the London-based Evening Standard newspaper earlier this week that he believed the group would continue to build up exports to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\"Worldwide this industry is buoyant,\" he said.Imperial has said in earlier mission statements that it will expand abroad through \"organic growth and acquisition.\"But with 1.1 billion pounds in debt as part of its Hanson inheritance, industry watchers wonder just how it will finance its much needed expansion.

That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders.Shipments of finished products and order backlogs also increased from June, suggesting firm underlying strength in the economy's industrial sector as the second half began.Orders for costly durable goods like new cars, refrigerators and other items intended to last three years or more rose a revised 1.7 percent in July to $172.9 billion after a 0.2 percent fall in June.Previously the department said June factory orders had fallen more sharply, by 0.9 percent, but it revised that to a 0.7 percent decline.Strong July factory orders reinforced other signs that the economy entered the final six months of the year with considerable momentum.In a separate report, the department said consumer spending barely edged up in July, as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months.Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June. Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June.The department had previously reported a 1.6 percent rise in July durables orders, but it revised that up slightly.Orders for non-durables like food and paper products --items that are used up more quickly -- also picked up strongly in July, by 1.8 percent to $144.7 billion following a 1.2 percent decrease in June.Among durable products, the only category that showed a decline in July from June was transportation equipment, down 0.4 percent to $41.6 billion after a 1.3 percent June drop. But that was mainly because of a falloff in demand for military ships and tanks that offset a pickup in orders for new cars.Shipments of motor vehicles and parts grew by 5.4 percent in July after a 1.2 percent fall in June. In the automobile industry, shipments correspond to orders.Excluding transportation, factory orders were up 2.1 percent in July after easing in June by 0.6 percent.The biggest increase in July came in orders for electrical and electronic equipment, up 4.7 percent to $28 billion after a 3.8 percent June increase.Industrial machinery orders gained 2.9 percent to $32.6 billion following a 0.3 percent June rise.Total shipments of manufactured goods, which reflect more immediate demand than orders, increased by 1.2 percent in July to $312.7 billion after a 0.8 percent fall in June.Unfilled orders increased by 1 percent to $504.1 billion after a 0.7 percent June increase. It was the tenth increase in order backlogs in the past 11 months, indicating likely strength in manufacturing industries in coming months.Orders for non-defence capital goods, a measure of business' expansion plans, rose 0.6 percent in July after falling 0.1 percent in June.

{"token": "International investors will likely be lured back into Japanese government bonds after a weak corporate sentiment survey sharply curtailed the chances of an interest rate rise this year, analysts said on Wednesday.But the survey may prove to be a double-edged sword -- enticing politicians to unleash new stimulus measures as the economy falters -- and investors should be wary about going too overweight at the expense of other bond markets, they said.\"Certainly it's dramatically changed the outlook of the market,\" said Kirit Shah, chief market strategist at Sanwa.\"People were looking for JGB yields to head back up to 3.5 percent and mabe even four percent in a year's time but the tankan has radically shifted the trading range,\" said Shah, based in London.The Bank of Japan's quarterly corporate survey or \"tankan\" released earlier in Tokyo caught financial markets on the hop.The key diffusion index for major manufacturers -- which guages business sentiment -- fell to minus seven in August from minus three in May. Analysts had been expecting a slight rise.Paul Meader, who manages 200 million stg in fixed-income investments at Matheson Investment Management in London, added, \"The curve is very steep and that makes me feel perhaps international managers may start to look at extending up the curve a little bit.\"Bond markets surged in Japan and held onto gains in London. The yield on the key 182nd 10-year bond fell below three percent in Tokyo for the first time since February.It was quoted at 3.03 percent in London at 1150 GMT.The survey revealed an economy still in dire straights and put a rise in the 0.5 percent official discount rate off until next year, analysts said.In such a weak economic environment, the bond market would continue to make gains, said Stuart Thomson, chief international economist at Nikko (Europe).\"I would expect it to maintain this bullish stance in the near term,\" he said.He forecast the yield on the 10-year bond dipping to 2.80 percent in the next few weeks. Matheson's Meader put 2.75 percent as his target.But troubles loom beyond the short term, analysts said.While Japan's Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said the tankan would not lead to any immediate decision on the need for an extra budget, analysts said the urge may prove irresistable, particularly with an election due by mid-1997.\"This weak economic scenario increases scope for another fiscal stimulus package and the budget deficit will become even more horrendous and supply will hit the market some time down the road,\" Shah said.Meader added that with one of largest budget deficits of developed countries, interest rates at rock bottom and the yen continuing weak, the economy already had plenty of stimulus.\"From a bond market perspective that fiscal stimulus, interest rate stimulus and currency stimulus is a very dangerous cocktail and it justifies real yields much higher and nominal yields much higher,\" he said.Meader said Matheson may increase its weighting slightly in JGBs from its slim eight percent weighting. The JP Morgan global bond index has a benchmark of 15 percent, he said.But Shah would opt for U.S. Treasuries instead. \"The budget deficit in the U.S. is in much better shape. The roles have reversed from the 1980s to the 1990s,\" he said.Nikko's Thomson preferred core Europe and particularly the short-end of Germany.-- International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6176", "label": ["M12", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "A Sicilian Mafia turncoat was detained on Thursday for allegedly ordering killings, including those of a young widow and a 14-year-old boy, while under a protection programme, state television reported.RAI television said turncoat Giuseppe Ferone, 41, was one of five people held in connection with the shootings of Santa Puglisi, 22, and Salvatore Botta in a cemetery in the Sicilian city of Catania on Tuesday.Puglisi, 22, was shot as she knelt praying by the tomb of her husband, who died last year in a Mafia ambush.Botta, who had accompanied Puglisi to the cemetery, tried to flee from the lone gunman but was caught and killed.Police sources said that Ferone was detained with others at a safe house in Anzio, on the Mediterranean coast south of Rome, and questioned by magistrates for nearly five hours.Police in Catania meanwhile said they had seized an arsenal, including 20 rifles, sub-machine guns, plastic explosives, ammunition and electronic detonators.The haul also included police uniforms, blank driving licences and radios tuned in to police frequencies.The reports fuelled an already heated debate in Italy over whether former Mafia killers can be trusted and should benefit from a generous protection programme that includes reduced sentences, a salary and a new identity.The issue has returned to the headlines after jailed Mafia boss Giovanni Brusca, accused of a string of murders, was reported to be collaborating with police.Magistrates have said they will treat Brusca cautiously, in case his \"repentance\" proves to be an attempt to mislead investigators and win favourable treatment.Giuseppe Ayala, an undersecretary at the justice ministry, told RAI's TG1 news that the \"pentito\" (turncoat) programme could not be discredited by one person.\"You cannot wipe out an overall contribution that is of exceptional importance just because one criminal, after becoming a \"pentito\", becomes a criminal again,\" he said.Enzo Guarnera, a lawyer who has defended turncoats, told Sicilian regional television that if the reports were true then Ferone had clearly deceived a lot of people.RAI said Ferone, a Catania boss who began cooperating with investigators after his son and father died in 1994 in a bloody power struggle between Mafia families, was believed to have ordered the cemetery killings.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "German electronics giant Siemens on Thursday angrily rejected German television claims that it botched construction at a nuclear plant which activitists want shut down for health reasons.Siemens denied that its Kraftwerksunion (KWU) unit had improperly welded together three parts of a reactor pressure vessel which were installed in the controversial Kruemmel nuclear plant in 1978.A Siemens spokesman told Reuters that a \"technically unavoidable and generally accepted re-alignment, totalling only several millimetres\" was made when the three pieces, which were too large to transport in one section, arrived at the plant.Siemens was responding in advance to the planned broadcast of a television news programme, scheduled to be aired at 1900 GMT, which alleges the industrial giant bungled the job.The \"Monitor\" programme says Siemens used \"violent\" hydraulic pressure to re-align the three parts and that the extra pressure could have led to the reactor pressure vessel bursting.Monitor released a summary of the programme contents ahead of its broadcast.Siemens spokesman Mark Derbacher said: \"The vessel sections are 23 metres long, 20 metres wide and 17 centimetres thick, weighing around 800 tonnes. That is why they are delivered in three sections,\" needing to be welded together on site.Derbacher added the process conformed to required safety standards and that there could be no allegations of negligent behaviour on Siemens' part. He cited a 1988 court ruling confirming that KWU's work had complied with safety rules.Activists have already filed court papers seeking to shut down Kruemmel, alleging that it has leaked radio-active emissions leading to a high incidence of cancer around the plant in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.The television programme adds another twist to a brewing controversy surrounding the ageing nuclear reactor.On Wednesday, two German physicians filed a civil action to close the Kruemmel plant alleging it was directly responsible for a high incidence of leukaemia among children, said to be up to 70 times higher than elsewhere in Germany.The plant's operator, Hamburg Elektrizitaets-Werke, remains convinced that there is no link between the operation of the power plant and leukaemia among children in the area.", "label": ["C24", "C33", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Corporate America is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years, according to a recent study.What it comes down to is this: If you're highly skilled, you'll benefit nicely. But if you're not and cannot contribute to your employer's goals, you'll be paid less.The survey, conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm Towers Perrin, showed that the focus will be on an employee's overall value to the company's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task.Presently, for example, if an accountant's job involves doing five specific tasks, he or she can expect a certain salary, said Sandra O'Neal, a Towers Perrin principal.In the future, the accountant will be evaluated solely on \"knowledge, skill and abilities,\" she said.In addition to using accounting skills, the accountant will also have to be creative, work well in a team, be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals.\"The good news is, if you're highly skilled and have many abilities, you'll be paid more,\" said O'Neal.\"The bad news is, if you're not skilled and can't contribute to a team, to customer service and the organisation's goals, you'll be paid less.\"Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed, 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years, and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result.Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure, and 78 percent report that they are considering a new, skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees.This coming shift, O'Neal said, \"is not just isolated or a fad. It's an inexorable change.\"After World War II, corporations adopted a \"military model\" creating hierarchical organisations where \"the concept of defined tasks worked great,\" she said.But as the economy became global, customers were more demanding and problems became more complex.\"Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers,\" O'Neal said.Now organisations must change to stay competitive.O'Neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises. If your team does well, you'll do well. If it doesn't do well, don't expect a raise.Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that can't keep up?\"That's an important question we used to ask a lot,\" said O'Neal. \"It's not a question we ask any more. The more important question is -- 'Do we have results?'\"To get those results, 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives, such as employee and team award programmes and education.Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well, O'Neal said.For example, the survey rated some participants in the survey as \"high-performing\" companies, based on their return on equity above 16 percent.Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education, give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success.\"They respect employees more, they trust employees more and they value their employees more,\" O'Neal said.\"The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership.

On Algeria and Lybia, he said, \"We are negotiating deals in both countries which we may or may not complete within the next few months but we hope we can.\"Craven Walker said Monument Oil did not fear a recent U.S. law punishing oil and gas investments by foreign firms in Lybia and Iran.Monument's investments would be too small to be targeted by the new law, while the British firm has no assets in the U.S. which could be subject of any sanctions, he said.-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717", "label": ["C151", "C15", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The California state Senate approved legislation Friday that was expected to clear the way for final passage next week of the $10.5 billion California Earthquake Authority plan.The Senate approved a so-called \"trailer\" bill containing amendments smoothing over differences between insurance companies and homeowner groups. The bill passed by 32-to-0.\"These are the final amendments to make it (the authority) financially feasible,\" said Republican Senator John Lewis from Orange County. \"It is voluntary for the insurance companies and it is voluntary for the consumers.\"  The proposed $10.5 billion earthquake authority stalled in the state Senate in July after concerns were raised the legislation was not consumer-friendly enough and homeowners in the San Francisco Bay area were being asked to pay too much.The authority was proposed as part of a plan to help solve the state's homeowners insurance crisis.Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer, D-Hayward, who in July had held up approval of the authority plan, said Friday that the authority, with the amendments, could become a model for the nation in dealing with disasters.  The trailer bill called for a more scientific approach to setting earthquake insurance rates. The bill also required that the insurance industry retain its contingent liability for 12 years. Originally, the industry was expected to retain its contigent liability for 10 years.As part of the $10.5 billion authority, about $1.5 billion would be raised through the sale of so-called \"catastrophe\" bonds that would be issued through the state.\"It doesn't take care of all the problems for the policy holders and the insurance industry,\" said Senator Charles Calderon, the newly elected Senate Democratic majority leader.  But Calderon added, \"It provides certainty for the policy holders and the industry. For the homeowners' market, it provides stability. Equivalent rates for equivalent risk will prevail.\"Some lawmakers were still somewhat concerned by the plan.Senator Quentin Kopp, an Independent from San Francisco, said he was concerned rates in the San Francisco area would still be higher than other regions despite the amendments.The state Assembly, which has already approved the main California Earthquake Authority legislation, was expected to act on the trailer bill early next week.The Senate would take up the main legislation creating the authority once the Assembly approved the trailer bill.", "label": ["C13", "C21", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GDIS", "GENV", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

We cannot be the world's policeman -- but where our values, and our interests are at stake, America must act -- and America must lead.\"Clinton devoted only a few moments of his hour-long speech to foreign policy. Following are some of his comments:-- Cuba must join the \"family of Democracies.\"-- The United States would continue its strong partnership with a democratic Russia.-- Some of Europe's new democracies (in eastern Europe) would be brought into NATO, \"so their freedom is never in doubt again.\"-- Measures to further reduce nuclear arsenals, banish poison gas, and ban nuclear tests must be enforced and ratified.-- Funding for modernising U.S. weapons would be increased by 40 percent by the year 2000 to keep the U.S. armed forces \"the best-trained and best-equipped\" in the world.-- The United States would develop \"sensible\" defences against missile attack. But in reference to ambitious proposals by his Republican opponent Bob Dole, Clinton said: \"We must not -- now or by the year 2000 -- squander $60 billion on an unproved, ineffective \"Star Wars\" programme that could be obsolete tomorrow.\"", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

That in turn led to mass rallies ofgun-owners and fears for the prime minister's security.Addressing one angry pro-gun rally in June, Prime MinisterJohn Howard wore what looked like a bullet-proof vest under hisjacket.

{"token": "Moslem villagers on Saturday came to the aid of Hindu pilgrims stranded by heavy snow and driving rain on a rugged Himalayan route after 96 people died from exposure, Indian officials said.Thousands of devout Hindus began an annual trek to the Amarnath cave last week to worship a stalgamite believed to be the manifestation of the phallus of the Hindu god Shiva. But the procession was hit by heavy rain and snow.Among the dead were many naked \"sadhus\", or Hindu holy men who smear their bodies with ash.\"The main reason for these deaths is that the pilgrims were not equipped with warm clothing and most of the holy men who died were trekking naked,\" said Asrar Ahmad, a doctor at a pilgrim camp in Anantnag, 50 km (30 miles) south of Srinagar.Rescue attempts were hindered by bad weather on the approach to the cave 3,880 metres (12,725 ft) high in the Himalayas.\"Due to torrential rains and snowfall the helicopters with rescue teams could not land at any place in the region,\" K.B. Jandial, spokesman for the Jammu and Kashmir state government, told Reuters.\"But we have received reports that local villagers are helping more and more pilgrims to trek down from high altitude areas,\" he said.Army officials said they were providing shelter and aid to nearly 40,000 pilgrims at army camps set up along the route.\"We have distributed thousands of food packets,\" said Lt-Col Anil Bhatt, a public relations officer in New Delhi. \"Eight army mobile hospitals are busy treating the trekkers for exposure.\"Bhatt said army personnel escorted the trekkers down the slopes, carrying the ill and injured through pouring rain.An official statement said thousands of trekkers stranded in the upper reaches had safely made their way down to Pahalgam town, the base camp for the trek.\"Villagers are taking the pilgrims into their homes, giving them food and blankets and warm clothing,\" said senior police official A.K. Suri, who flew over the area in a helicopter on Saturday but was unable to land because of the poor weather.Over 112,000 Hindus arrived in Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Moslem-majority state, for the trek.Scheduled to end on Wednesday, the trek was suspended until weather conditions improved.The cave's entrance was deep in 33 cm (13 inches) of snow, a weather department official said. Since Friday, 85 mm (3.3 inches) of rain has lashed Srinagar, the state's summer capital.Rescue teams tried unsucessfully to land medicines and other essentials for more than 3,000 people stranded at Panchtarni, 3,700 metres (12,136 ft) high, spokesman Jandial said.\"They are at the mercy of nature,\" he added.Teams of Indian paramilitary forces set to work to clear the 300-km (200-mile) highway between Srinagar and Jammu in the south. The job was expected to take three days.About 25,000 people were stranded in Jammu, the state's winter capital, after floods and landslides caused by torrential rains blocked the highway.Last year the pilgrimage was threatened by Moslem separatist guerrillas who staged two bomb attacks on the heavily guarded pilgrims. A state civil servant was killed in one of the blasts.Some 20,000 people have died since a separatist revolt broke out in 1990 in Jammu and Kashmir, police and hospital sources say. This year guerrillas issued no ban on the pilgrimage. Instead, bad weather has endangered the pilgrims' lives.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIS", "GREL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

It added cooperation between Lloyd's and London insurers needed to be extended to ensure London's competitiveness as an insurance market.  \"Client demand for high levels of security and the arrival in London of large underwriting units with high levels of capacity have been coupled with a shrinkage of traditional subscription business in recent years,\" the report said.After poor underwriting results and loss reserve deterioration, many companies have been driven out of the market, the agency said.But S&P insurance director Rowena Potter said in the report that London will continue to be pre-eminent for marine, aviation and a number of niches, where the expertise or size of the exposure demands a London placement.  Most insurers in London are now part of multinationals based elsewhere and this has brought a more professional and disciplined approach to underwriting, the report said.\"This trend towards more professional players and better market discipline is mirrored by events at Lloyd's,\" Potter said. \"The number of syndicates operating has contracted dramatically, and corporate capital has become intertwined with that of the company market.\"The major London market companies also are now substantially more heavily capitalised, to provide greater capacity and attract better quality business, S&P said.  \"In the mid-1980s new companies were entering the London market with as little as five million stg in capital. Mergers and use of capital markets mean that the level is now much higher, and the agency believes that new participants would now require at least 50 million stg in initial capital.\"S&P said an upward trend of its ratings of London market companies over the last two years was partly due to guarantees and support from strong parents.\"But increased professionalism means that most companies are stronger now in their own right,\" the agency said.--International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6784", "label": ["C17", "C174", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Franco-German helicopter maker Eurocopter is engaged in sensitive talks with the French government aimed at ensuring its passage through an order famine which could entail job losses, officials said on Saturday.Jean-Francois Bigay, chairman of Eurocopter told reporters ahead of the biennial Farnborough airshow, that the world helicopter market would remain difficult in the medium term because of tough competition and stagnant sales.The company, a joint venture between French state-owned SNI Aerospatiale and Daimler-Benz Aerospace of Germany, has sufficient orders for 1997 and 1998 but then faces a lean period until it delivers the first Tiger combat helicopter to the French army in 2002.France's centre-right French government has slashed spending in the defence budget for 1997-2002 and has earmarked funds for only four super Puma transport helicopters.The defence cuts have raised labour union concern that 1,000 Eurcopter jobs could go in France on top of the 800 French posts and 350 German posts to be axed in a current restructuring plan which runs until 1997.The French government is highly sensitive to any job losses as the latest figures show the unemployment rate at a record 12.5 percent and unions are opposing a budget freeze for 1997 which will lead to up to 7000 layoffs in the civil service.France is scheduled to have a general election in 1998.Aerospatiale chairman Yves Michot said Eurocopter was in talks with the government to see whether more measures will be needed after 1997.He said the government had asked him in the first half of this year whether more had to be done because orders were not being placed.Since then, however, Eurocopter received about five billion French francs ($988 million) in new orders, selling aircraft to Abu Dhabi, Saud Arabia and Spain. \"The orders are now coming in. It is clear we have to implement the whole of the restructuring plan as it was conceived.\"Beyond that we will have to discuss to see what the situation is and whether or not to take further measures,\" Michot said.Bigay, however, said it looked like no fresh job cuts would be needed on top of those in the current restructuring plan.\"We think for the moment our order book for 1997 and 1998 gives us a clear view that there will be no significant change in the very short term, which is not to say there won't be a problem until 2002,\" he said.Bigay said the government expects to make a small loss in 1996 and break even in 1997 as a result of the restructuring plan. He gave no figures for profits.He forecast Eurocopter's turnover for 1996 would be 9.8 billion francs and 9.56 billion francs in 1997, compared to 9.32 billion in 1995.The company expects the payroll to shrink to 8,900 in 1997 from an estimated 9,500 this year and 9,800 in 1995.

On Thursday, a U.S. trader failed to secure a deal for an early September loading 100,000-barrel cargo despite offering it down to $28.60 per barrel, 50 cents per barrel below the previous day's offer free-on-board (FOB) Singapore, trade sources said.They said the same trader had offered to sell a 40,000 tonne cargo arriving in Singapore in early September. Another Mid-East 30,000 tonne cargo was sold mid-week to a U.S. major at 10 cents per barrel above the Singapore spot price cost-and-freight (c-and-f).  Bearish traders pointed to the emergence of spot product from Thailand, the first time the country has offered jet fuel for export, as another reason jet could fall.A Thai refiner is looking to export a small 5,000-tonne cargo for loading in Singapore in early September.The traders said North Asia, the traditional market for jet fuel in the fourth quarter, has covered a lot of its requirements for the winter via term contracts.South Korea is expected to lower its spot purchases by about 30 percent while one leading Japanese refiner has already secured about half its requirement.  China has also sealed a contract to buy 100,000 tonnes of jet fuel in the fourth quarter.Other trading sources, however, said prices would remain steady despite the current over supply in Singapore.One trader said support was likely to come from Indonesia which has a series of refineries due for maintenance from September to November.As a result, Indonesia is expected to raise its monthly demand during this period by at least 500,000 barrels to around 1-1.5 million barrels, he said.  Another said jet fuel prices would be hard pressed to fall steeply because demand for other products, especially gas oil, was strong.Gas oil, he said, would cushion any big fall in jet fuel prices. Gas oil is currently trading at about $25.60 per barrel FOB Singapore with the jet fuel/gas oil spread at $2.80 per barrel.\"We are going into the fourth quarter and the jet fuel/gas oil is traditionally at its highest during this period,\" he said.  But others said the start up of new regional refineries made such historical comparisons irrelevant.They point to the unexpectedly high August jet fuel/gas oil spread at above $3.00 per barrel against a more usual $1 per barrel in the previous year as an example of fundamental changes in trading patterns taking place.--Singapore Newsroom (+65-870-3093)", "label": ["M14", "M143", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Residents and tourists on the Outer Banks of North Carolina stuck to plans to spend the Labor Day holiday weekend at beach communities on Saturday as the threat of Hurricane Edouard receded.Edouard, with maximum winds of 120 mph (190 kph), was a threat to coastal areas from the Carolinas to New England. But on its current northerly track, the storm was more likely to threaten northeastern coastal areas, National Hurricane Center meteorologist Bill Frederick said.\"With the forecast track, the threat decreases some for North Carolina,\" Frederick said. \"If it continues on its present track, it increases the threat to the northeast coast.\"In the Outer Banks, all roads and campgrounds were open, as were inns and shops, and ferries were functioning.\"We have not been touched with storm-force or gale-force winds whatsoever,\" Sandy Sanderson, director of Dare County Emergency Management Services, said. \"We're not encouraging people to stay away.\"Although cars with surfboards on the roof were headed toward the beach, swimming was banned, Sanderson said. People instead were biking, jogging, in-line skating and golf in Manteo and neighboring Nags Head, Kill Devil Hills and Kitty Hawk.At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), the center of Edouard was located at latitude 32.1 north, longitude 70.3 west, about 370 miles (590 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and was moving north at 12 mph (19 kph).Forecasters posted a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning from Cape Lookout, North Carolina, north to Cape Henlopen, Delaware, including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, and said watches and warnings might be extended farther north during the U.S. Labor Day holiday weekend.The Federal Emergency Management Agency geared up for Edouard's possible arrival on the East Coast, putting on alert emergency teams armed with communications equipment, power generators and supplies, officials said.But for Susan Scofield, visiting North Carolina from Washington state, Edouard was less a threat than a spectacle. \"It's exciting,\" she said, watching from a walkway near her Nags Head hotel as the waves climbed.The Outer Banks are a slender strip of islands inside the Gulf Stream and in some places more than 20 miles (32 km) from the North Carolina mainland. The barrier islands, as they are called, prevent big ocean waves and storm surges from reaching the mainland.They are home to about 42,000 people and a prime tourist attraction. Members of the hotel industry said Edouard was not affecting business.\"The Weather Channel didn't overreact this time. It just destroyed us last time,\" Holiday Inn manager Michelle Sears said, referring to Hurricane Bertha, which struck last month.On Hatteras Island, home to seven villages, townspeople were viewing the hurricane casually, although shopkeepers had stacks of cut plywood ready if they needed to board windows quickly.Work crews had removed sand from ocean overwash on Highway 12, the only main road, after high tide on Friday. Residents said it was not unusual for the road to become impassable.In Virginia Beach, Virginia, people played volleyball and strolled along an oceanfront boardwalk, but swimmers were warned away from the water because of strong undertows.Forecasters were also tracking Tropical Storms Fran and Gustav, but neither presented any immediate threat to land.At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), Fran's center was located at latitude 21.3 north, longitude 61.6 west, about 350 miles (560 km) northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and was moving northwest at 6 mph (9 kph). Maximum sustained winds were near 70 mph (110 kph), and forecasters said Fran could regain hurricane strength later on Saturday.Tropical Storm Gustav was located near latitude 18.8 north, longitude 42.8 west, about 1,250 miles (2,010 km) east of the Leeward Islands, and was moving northwest at almost 12 mph (19 kph).

Some say it is expected to the extent that when it happens profit-taking might force prices down.Today's German M3 data which came out on the soft side left the hopes of a repo cut intact. Dealers said today's Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting would likely be ignored.  With traders split on whether to switch to flattening trades or continue with curve steepening purchases at the short end on hopes of further gains, the market was practically stuck.\"The trend remains pro-steepening...there is no appetite to buy 15- or 20-year paper,\" said one trader. Talk of a new 10-year benchmark bond in September would add to price pressure at the longer end, he added.Most of the early action took place in the two- to three-year area, attention later shifted to the four- to seven-years which saw some selling pressure.  But another trader said the market was overdiscounting the Bundesbank action on Thursday, limiting the upside. He recommended flattening trades.For the longer term the yield trend was down, dealers said, pointing to a return of cash to the market. \"The consensus is that the market (prices) will go higher,\" one said.But he added he would not buy at current levels. \"We have seen a nice rally of about half a point.\" He linked buying levels to the September German Bund future, which at 1625 GMT was down 0.07 at 98.01, failing to take out resistance at 98.25.

{"token": "Searchers began a perilous task on Friday to recover bodies from a Russian airliner that crashed into a mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen, killing all 141 people aboard.Police and an accident inquiry team went by helicopter to the inaccessible crash site on this remote Norwegian island and officials said mountain climbers might even be called in.The victims were mainly Ukrainian and Russian coalminers and their families.\"The first thing is that the dead will be counted and tagged. Then the victims will be bagged, sent by helicopter to Longyear and afterwards flown to Tromsoe (in mainland Norway) for autopsy,\" said police coordinator Ivar Follestad.Norwegian police also began interviewing residents of the close-knit communities to seek witnesses who may have seen or heard the blue, brown and white Tupolev Tu-154 jet plough into a mountain on Thursday as it prepared to land.Most of the three-engined plane, smashed and broken, is stranded on a mountaintop some seven km (four miles) east of Longyear. The tail section broke off and slid down the steep mountainside, scarring the surface and blackening the snow.The windblown, chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town were all but deserted and flags flew at half-mast.\"It's a sight I will never forget. I will remember it for the rest of my life,\" said Stig Onarheim, one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday, hoping in vain to find survivors.\"Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board. Think of all that mixed together, with twisted, wrecked parts on the slope,\" Onarheim, 29, told Reuters.The crash site is inaccessible by land and there is danger from avalanches and polar bears, rescue officials said.Local government officials and police were guarding the site around the clock to keep animals away and a small hut had been erected to house accident investigators.But officials said it could days or weeks to bring all the bodies down from the mountain.Police said mountain climbers could be needed to reach the tail section of the plane, which slid down the steep mountainside after the crash.All 129 passengers and 12 crew were killed.The Tupolev Tu-154 was bringing miners and some of their families, 76 of them from Ukraine, to work in a Russian open-cast mine. Spitzbergen is governed by Norway but Russia has rights of access under an international treaty from the 1920s.The cause of the crash remains a mystery. Police and local officials declined to speculate at a news conference on Friday whether the plane flew off course or was coming in too low.Russian emergency service officials arrived on an identical plane to the one that crashed. Some 91 miners, due to be relieved by the miners who died, were due to fly back later.Investigators are hoping to recover the plane's flight data recorders from the crash site.Western aviation experts have raised questions about the safety of Russian airline operations following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. But the pilot was experienced and did not report any trouble before the plane crashed.Yevgeny Buzny, an official of the Russian mining company which chartered the plane, said there were seven children and 4O women on the plane.The miners were on their way to start work in the Russian towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden.Harsh, remote conditions mean that few other than miners from the former Soviet Union, pressed by job losses and falling wages at home, would brave Spitzbergen.Fewer than 3,000 people live on the island which has one of the world's harshest climates and lies some 500 miles (800 km) off the northern tip of Norway.Arktikugol (Arctic Coal), the Russian firm that works the Barentsburg and Pyramiden open-cast pits on the island, sends its 2,000 workers there on contracts of up to three years at a stretch.Stig Kristiansen, a shopowner in Longyear, said some of those waiting to leave had come into his shop just before Thursday's accident.\"They were smiling,\" he told Norwegian television. \"Then, half an hour later, they were crushed.\"", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIS"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

But those queried were more disappointed with Ciba, which fell short of estimates ranging from 11 to 13 percent.\"Both companies' results were below our expectations and below the consensus estimates,\" said Bank Julius Baer analyst Beat Alpiger. He said a poor financial result was one part of Ciba's problem.Ciba reported a first half financial loss of 76 million after a 1995 first half deficit of 116 million. Interest income fell by 57 million francs due to a sharp drop in money market rates. Investments in fixed income were kept at a low level.The two companies, which in March announced their plans to merge, said they were discussing with potential buyers various divestment options in their U.S. crop protection and animal health businesses.The European Commission approved the merger in July and the two groups now expect U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) clearance of their merger in late Autumn. The divestiture talks were aimed at expediting this process.However, analysts agreed that profit margins should become more attractive once the merger took effect and the promised synergies had had their impact.\"What we will see in 1996 is less important for the investment community than the question of whether the progress in integrating the two companies goes according to plan,\" Baer's Alpiger said.Sandoz said its pharmaceuticals business saw margins improve considerably in the first half thanks to strong growth in key products and continued cost control programmes.The group's first half operating income, excluding divestments, rose to 1,632 million francs from 1,497 million in the 1995 period.($1=1.1957 Swiss Franc)", "label": ["C151", "C15", "C152", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Swedish banks, firmly back in the black after a credit crash in the early 1990s, are vying for position as the industry braces itself for what banking sources tip to be a shake-out in the near term.\"I think there's good reason to believe that within the foreseeable future there won't be as many names on the market as there are today,\" Swedbank executive vice president Gunnar Andersson told Reuters.The half-year reporting season marked an end to a spiral of corporate failures and loan losses that brought some Swedish banks to the verge of failure and took others beyond it.Handelsbanken, Swedbank and Nordbanken posted hikes in profits after credit losses of between 17 and 46 percent, while S-E-Banken saw profits of 2.72 billion crowns ($410 million) after disastrous currency speculation wiped out almost all its earnings for the first half of 1995.More importantly, all of the big four banks reported a loan loss to total lending ratio of around 0.5 percent, a level reminiscent of the 1980s, when negative real interest rates made borrowing money a profitable activity.The underlying profitability of the retail operations of Sweden's major banks has never been seriously challenged. In combination with a highly conservative dividend policy, this has left them very highly capitalised.Speculation on a shake-out in the strong, cash-rich banking sector has grown, with no shortage of potential predators and at least two attractive targets.Foreningsbanken is one. Swedbank's overtures to the traditional farmers' bank in June -- which included taking a five percent share stake -- were firmly rebuffed by management, which instead called on insurance group Lansforsakringar to increase its interest.Lansforsakringar dashed its hopes on Friday by saying it would consider selling its three percent stake to the highest bidder -- even if that bidder were Swedbank.Foreningsbanken's saviour could turn out to be farmers' union LRF, which said in June it had no reason to sell its 20 percent stake in the bank to Swedbank or anyone else.Mortgage institute Stadshypotek is another ripe target for banks looking to expand. The state has said it hopes to dispose of its 34 percent stake by the end of December and there will be no shortage of bidders.Industry analysts tip state-controlled Nordbanken as the bank most likely to succeed. Stadshypotek's home loan business would help Nordbanken compete with arch-rival Swedbank in this lucrative area.But competition from other banks and Stadshypotek's price tag present two serious obstacles to Nordbanken.Handelsbanken president Arne Martensson said on Tuesday he would not rule out bidding for Stadshypotek. Insurer Trygg-Hansa is also widely tipped as a serious contender.Another problem is how high a bid for Stadshypotek should be pitched. Analysts said Nordbanken would need to offer a premium over the current share price of around 170 crowns, something that would raise serious doubts on the profitability of the venture.The possibility of a merger between two of the big four seems remote, even though foreign analysts have commented on the obvious synergies available from such a move.For one thing, the four are more or less equal in size, with a market capitalisation of between 20 and 30 billion crowns.Secondly, the corporate cultures of the Wallenberg-dominated S-E-Banken, the state-controlled Nordbanken, the conservative Handelsbanken and the autonomous Swedbank foundations offer little scope for intermarriage.Which leaves the possibility of a foreign player snapping up a profitable, overcapitalised, efficient and undervalued bank.

It wasn't by your own strength,\" he said.He announced a 20,000 Liberian dollar ($270) contribution towards repairing the damaged chapel.West African heads of state and Liberian faction leaders agreed on Saturday to appoint former Liberian senator Ruth Perry to lead the ruling council and set a timetable for disarmament by the end of January and elections on or around May 30.The latest agreement threatens faction leaders with sanctions, including seizure of assets and war crimes tribunals, if they are seen to be obstructing the peace process.Faction leaders have already accused each other of breaking a ceasefire which was supposed to come into force on Tuesday.Perry said on Thursday she would travel to Grand Cape Mount, her home county in western Liberia, to halt clashes reported there between Johnson's and Kromah's supporters.Perry, 57, was a Liberian senator during the 1980s under the government of slain president Samuel Doe.Over a dozen peace deals have failed to end the war launched by Charles Taylor and his National Patriotic Front of Liberia in late 1989. Taylor and Kromah are both vice-chairmen on the Council of State.Their attempt to arrest Johnson for murder in April triggered some of the bloodiest fighting of the war in the streets of Monrovia.

{"token": "Many of the German Nazi-hunters who let former SS captain Erich Priebke slip through their fingers in the 1970s were themselves former Nazis, according to a regional parliamentary document.Priebke was found guilty of murder four weeks ago by a military tribunal in Rome for his part in the massacre of 335 men and boys in the Ardeatine caves near Rome in 1944 -- the worst atrocity committed in Italy in World War Two.But he was spared prison as a 30-year statute of limitations had expired. He is now held pending possible extradition to Germany, which wants to try him on related murder charges.German prosecutors in the city of Dortmund have admitted they bungled a chance to indict Priebke more than 20 years ago.But a reply by the then justice minister of North Rhine-Westphalia to the state assembly last year shows that all three senior state prosecutors responsible for Priebke's file between 1947 and 1973 had been members of the Nazi party.For post-war senior justice officials to have been former Nazis is not in itself unusual. Most had been members of Hitler's party, either enthusiastically or simply to further their careers, and had to undergo post-war screening for serious transgressions before being allowed to serve again.But the minister, Rolf Krumsiek, conceded in his reply that \"from today's point of view, their employment in (the office investigating Nazi war crimes) seems scarcely understandable\".His reply was unearthed in a weekend edition of the regional Westfaelische Rundschau newspaper.One of the three senior prosecutors joined the Nazis before Hitler came to power in 1933, the other two shortly afterwards.All were active in the NSRB Nazi jurists' association, two even held office in Hitler's Sturmabteilung (SA) militia.Senior prosecutor Hermann Weissing, who is now in charge of the Dortmund war crimes unit, said last week that prosecutors had all the documents they needed to indict Priebke, but that the case was inexplicably bungled.In particular, they had evidence from the 1948 trial in Italy of Priebke's SS commander Herbert Kappler. The documents were shelved in 1971 without being translated or evaluated.Priebke lived in Argentina for decades after the war, not concealing his identity from the German consulate and even coming to Germany on visits.Germany finally issued an warrant for him last year after he had been tracked down by a journalist and admitted taking part in the massacre, a Nazi retaliation measure for a partisan bomb attack on German soldiers.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The economy grew even faster last spring than the rapid pace first reported, the government said Thursday, raising doubts a second-half slowdown will occur soon enough to head off higher interest rates.A series of reports showed stronger-than-expected overall economic growth in the spring, a big jump in new-home sales in July and a firm labour market that analysts said was underpinning solid job and income gains.The Commerce Department said the nation's gross domestic product grew at a revised 4.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter -- the strongest in two years -- up from the initial 4.2 percent rate estimated a month ago. GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced in the United States.The second-quarter performance more than doubled the first quarter's 2 percent growth rate and was expected to fuel concern among Federal Reserve policy-makers about a possible pickup in inflation.\"The economy is not slowing down fast enough and that is going to lead to higher interest rates sooner rather than later,\" said economist Sung Won Sohn at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.He estimated there was a 50-50 chance the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee will raise short-term interest rates at its next meeting Sept. 24 in a bid to slow the economy and ward off inflation.Sohn said he thought the economy would grow at a 3 percent rate in the third quarter, well above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent pace that central bank policy-makers consider sustainable without risking a jump in wages and prices.The department said in a separate report that sales of new homes jumped 7.9 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February, when new homes were selling at rate of 784,000 a year.In a third report, the Labour Department said new claims for unemployment insurance rose 4,000 to 331,000 last week. The four-week moving average, considered a more accurate gauge because it levels out the volatile weekly numbers, increased by 9,250 to 323,250 claims.The White House sought credit for the strong economic performance, with chief economist Joseph Stiglitz noting the GDP data \"strengthens our view that the U.S. economy is achieving the kind of strong economic growth that can raise America's living standards.\"Robert Dederick, economic consultant to Northern Trust Co., said that notwithstanding last week's rise in jobless claims,the labour market remains \"very, very firm.\"\"It does seem that the Fed cannot afford to relax,\" Dederick said, adding that he foresees third-quarter GDP growth at a 2.8 percent to 3 percent rate with no indication of a slowdown in the fourth quarter.The big upward revision in second-quarter GDP rattled financial markets, and the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 14/32, or $4.38 on a $1,000 bond. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, climbed to 7.02 percent from 6.98 percent Wednesday.The jump in long-term interest rates contributed to a drop in the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial fell 43.28 points to 5,669.10 in afternoon trading.\"It shows the economy was very strong in the second quarter,\" said Gary Thayer, senior economist at AG Edwards and Sons Inc. \"If the economy is slowing down from this 4.8 percent annual rate, it would have to slow down quite a bit just to be back to normal.\"The last time the economy grew faster was the second quarter of 1994, when GDP expanded at a 4.9 percent annual rate.The department said several factors accounted for the stronger growth, including a smaller drag on the economy from huge trade imbalances with the rest of the world because imports were not as strong as originally thought.Imports grew at a 9.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter rather than 12.9 percent as estimated a month ago.Inventories were leaner heading into the second half than the department initially estimated. It said businesses added to stocks of unsold goods at a $7.2 billion annual rate in the quarter instead of a $10.3 billion rate estimated a month ago.A combination of increased business investment and smaller inventories suggested there was more room for companies to boost output in the second half.A possible restraint is that consumer spending in the second quarter was not as strong as first estimated. Personal consumption spending grew at a 3.4 percent annual rate rather than a 3.7 percent rate, the department said.Despite strong growth in the spring, there was little sign that prices were heating up. The implicit price deflator, a measure of inflation, rose at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the quarter -- the same as estimated a month ago -- down from a 2.2 percent increase in the first quarter.", "label": ["E11", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Shares on the Lima stock exchange closed down Tuesday, but investors maintained their enthusaism for electric companies, brokers said.Wednesday could see further drops, however, as brokers said they expect a technical correction in electricity stocks because investors hope to take profits on their recent buys.Tuesday, the General Index, fell 1.07 percent to 1399.12 points, while the blue-chip Selective Index slipped 0.71 percent to 1,913.53 points, according to preliminary stock figures.  Volume remained low at 35.7 million soles ($14.5 million) due to the continued absence of foreign investors, who have been discouraged from entering the market by recent investment bank reports, brokers said.In sluggish action, there were 2,374 trades, where 17 stocks rose, 31 fell and 37 were stable.Electric companies, which have dominated the market this month, again attracted the greatest interest Tuesday due to the sector's growth potential and the utilities' positive results in the first half of the year, brokers said.  Electricity generator Edegel rose 2.42 percent to 5.51 soles in volume of 6.6 million soles, while distributor Edelnor rose 3.89 percent to 3.47 soles in volume of 3.0 million soles.Accounting for 26 percent of the day's volume, Luz del Sur was the most heavily traded stock as it dipped 0.01 sol to 3.77 soles.The absence of foreign investors resulted in another session of lethargic trade for Telefonica del Peru. The benchmark closed down 0.18 percent at 5.48 soles on 907,000 shares.

{"token": "Polish T-bill yields are seen falling to around secondary market levels at next Monday's 600 million zloty primary aucton in large demand caused by cash surpluses on the money market, analysts said on Friday.\"Demand may be three times bigger than the treasury's relatively small offer and yields will inevitably fall,\" said Wojciech Kowalczyk, T-bill dealer at Bank Handlowy SA.Analysts said the average yield of the benchmark 52-week T-bill should ease to around 19.6 percent on Monday from 19.73 at the last primary auction.In secondary trade the benchmark was around 19.50 percent.\"Large demand will pull down yields at the tender but they are still likely to be slightly higher than Friday's secondary market yields,\" said Slawomir Komonski, treasurer of Societe Generale in Warsaw.Analysts said average yield of the shortest 8-week paper should fall to around 19 percent, from 19.06, percent and the yield of the 26-week paper to around 19.40, from 19.68.They said the average yield of the 13-week bill should fall to about 19.05 percent, down from 19.51 percent on August 5 -- the last primary auction at which they were offered.On Monday the Treasury will offer 300 million zlotys of the 52-week bills and 100 million each of the 8-week, 13-week, and 26-week papers.Analysts said money market cash surpluses, caused by a scale-down in the number of reverse repo drainages by the central bank, will create the large demand at Monday's auction.One-day interbank deposit rates tumbled to 12 percent on Friday from nearly 18 percent earlier this week as the central bank's longer term outright sales failed to clear up the market's excess cash.\"There is too much money on the market and banks need alternatives to overnight deposits at 12 percent,\" said Wojciech Labryga, dealer at Bank Slaski SA.Analysts said the money market would likely remain overliquid for much of next week, the last of the August reserve period, as some net three billion zlotys out flow into the market by Wednesday, August 28.\"Through the overliquidity banks build up surpluses on their required reserve accounts so they should not have any trouble balancing reserve positions next week,\" said one foreign bank dealer based in Poland..Analysts said Friday's three-day drainage rate cut to 17.70 percent, against 19.12 percent for the 14-day operation on August 20, showed the extent of the market's overliquidity.Analysts said banks may look to the Treasury's 391 million zloty one-year index-linked bond auction on Tuesday as an alternative to 52-week T-bills, but the auction was likely to be undersubscibed.They said the average price should inch up from the last auction on July 30 when it was 96.65. The bond's coupon is the base inflation rate with no premium.On the forex market the zloty should breeze through the week between 1.5 and two percent from the trading band centre in seasonally slower summer trade.\"There are no clear cut trends on the market other than adjustments to dollar/mark swings and the zloty is likely to remain in its present band next week,\" said Bogdan Stepkowski, forex dealer at ING bank in Warsaw.The zloty closed the week at 1.75 percent from the trading band centre against last week's close at 1.60 percent. On Friday the zloty closed at 2.7405/25 per dollar versus Thursday's 2.7420/60 and at 1.8423/28 to the mark, from 1.8430/85.-- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700", "label": ["M13", "M131", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "A first group of Africans expelled by France after a police raid on a Paris church landed in Senegal and Mali overnight. Airport staff dubbed a French plane carrying them a \"flight of shame\" and refused to handle it.More than 50 illegal immigrants from Senegal, Mali, Zaire and Gabon were put onto an Airbus 310 at a French military base for the journey home to the world's poorest continent after a long-running standoff at the Saint-Bernard church.On arrival, those who left the plane in Dakar remarked bitterly that they had fled poverty at home and had been forced to leave behind a new life and loved ones in France but official African reaction to the crisis has been muted.\"I have been in France for 16 years, I left my French wife there, my father, my mother and even my grandfather. I don't understand what's happening to me,\" one of 13 Senegalese deportees told reporters, declining to give his name.\"The French authorities must understand that we are not criminals but economic refugees. We left our country because life is difficult. That's the reality,\" he added.In France, Prime Minister Alain Juppe sought to soften the crackdown on illegal immigrants with promises of more humanity.Only four Africans out of 210 arrested in the church on Friday morning were deported on the charter plane with more than 50 other illegal immigrants bound for Mali, Senegal and Zaire on Saturday evening from a military airbase west of Paris.Witnesses said a French military supply plane accompanied the Airbus to Mali, where 23 people, including the four from the church, disembarked. The plane was due to leave for Zaire.Dozens of other immigrants, including 10 on the 50th day of a hunger strike when riot police smashed doors and windows to break into the church with batons and teargas, were in detention in France on Sunday. All children and most women were freed.The Interior Ministry said 40 of those seized in the church would be granted residence permits \"due to family or health situations\". The Africans had demanded residence rights for all.Defence lawyers said they would continue arguments in court on Sunday aimed at averting threatened new deportations.West African governments, vocal about the expulsion by Angola this month of illegal migrants from their region, have been muted in their reaction to events at the Paris church.But ground workers in Dakar refused the handle the French plane. \"No worker from Air Afrique should take part in this base task by helping these flights of shame on the ground,\" the Francophone African multinational carrier's union said.It urged ground staff in fellow African countries to boycott all such deportation flights from former colonial power France.From Dakar, the plane, which also carried 18 Zaireans and two Gabonese, later landed in Mali, where once again there were no airport staff on hand to service the plane.Political parties in Mali, where torrential rain fell on Sunday, planned a protest rally.In France, the church raid triggered protests against the centre-right government and clashes between stone-throwing protesters and riot police in Paris on Friday. Outside Evreux military airbase more than 100 people scuffled with police. One civilian, hurt in a police charge, was taken away by ambulance.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "The personal physician of the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu has resigned as Romania's health minister as part of a reshuffle by the leftist ruling party to boost its image ahead of elections.Bucharest radio said on Wednesday Health Minister Iulian Mincu and also Culture Minister Viorel Marginean had quit \"for personal reasons\".Government spokesman Ion Rosca told Reuters their departure was \"actually the reshuffle\" of the cabinet lead by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.Mincu, 69, gave a last insulin shot to Ceausescu hours before the dictator and his wife Elena fled Bucharest during the December 1989 popular revolt that ended communist rule. Ceausescu and his wife were later executed by firing squad.Mincu became notorious under Ceausescu as the author of a \"rational nutrition programme\" which denied consumption of meat and sweets to Romania's starving population.The programme was in line with the late dictator's drive to export most of the country's livestock and food products to earn hard currency and pay its huge foreign debt.Mincu, appointed by Vacaroiu as health minister in 1992, told Bucharest radio he had resigned on health grounds but would continue to act as a senator of the ruling leftist Party of Social Democracy (PDSR).Reports in the local media had said the PDSR planned a reshuffle in a last-ditch attempt to boost its image ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections due on November 3.Analysts had called for more radical surgery, with some asking even Vacaroiu to resign.Marginean had come under attack in the opposition press for allegedly using his position to spend large amounts from the public money to organise exhibits of his paintings abroad.Vacaroiu confirmed the reshuffle on Bucharest radio. \"We are determined to take all necessary measures, if needed,\" he said when asked whether he expected other changes in his cabinet.PDSR supporters had also called for a shake-up of the ranks of the government to improve its chances in November elections.Wednesday's reshuffle is the fifth since Vacaroiu was appointed in 1992. He has relied on nationalists and neo-communists to keep his hold on power.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Bob Dole has narrowed the gap to just five points behind President Bill Clinton since the announcement of his tax cut plan, the choice of Jack Kemp as running mate and the successful Republican convention, a Reuters poll said on Thursday.The poll of 1,007 likely voters conducted by John Zogby Group International from August 18-20 showed 41.5 percent supported Clinton and 36.3 percent Dole -- a gap of just 5.2 percentage points. Texas billionaire Ross Perot got 7.4 percent, 0.6 percent chose other candidates and 14.2 percent were undecided. The survey margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percent.The last Reuters-Zogby poll, released on August 6, had Dole 12 points behind Clinton.The gap narrowed even more when voters were asked about Dole's vice presidential running mate Jack Kemp. Asked in a separate question to choose between the candidates -- this time with vice presidential candidates Al Gore and Kemp included -- the margin narrowed to just 3.7 points.The Clinton/Gore ticket had the support of 42.8 percent, against 39.1 percent for Dole/Kemp. Support for Perot, who has yet to name a running mate, slipped to 6.1 percent.\"Dole certainly got his bounce from the Republican convention. He had a very good week -- a popular and focused tax cut plan that appears to have brought his base home, the startling selection of Jack Kemp as running mate, and an above average performance defining himself at a no-glitches convention,\" pollster John Zogby said.\"The race appears to be competitive, but it remains to be seen if the gap has closed enough, as the President has scheduled a big week with major bill signings as a segue to his convention in Chicago,\" he said, referring to the Democratic national convention next week.But when likely voters were asked which issues were most important to them, the results appeared to tip in Clinton's favor, Zogby said.Respondents named education, the integrity and character of the candidate, jobs and the economy, crime, and health care as the \"most important\" issues. Taxes, the issue on which Dole has staked his campaign, is well down the list of priorities.\"If you add the issues up, I think the balance gets tilted in favor of Clinton,\" Zogby said. \"Dole doesn't emerge from this with a major vote grabber, except for the integrity question,\" he added.In a separate question, 60.4 percent of respondents said they would be willing to forego Dole's proposed 15 percent tax cut if such a cut meant an increase in the budget deficit.Despite backing Clinton for President, voters appear to favor divided government in Washington. The poll shows they prefer Republicans to control both chambers of Congress. Survey respondents wanted Republicans in the Senate majority by 43.6 percent to 36.6 percent and in the House of Representatives by 40.8 percent to 37.7 percent.Zogby said that support for Clinton was stronger towards the end of the three-day polling period, following publicity about Clinton signing major pieces of legislation including a minimum wage increase and health care and welfare reforms.Zogby also said that Dole's post-convention bounce in the polls was vulnerable when viewed historically.\"I do recall that polls showed (Democrat) Walter Mondale in a dead heat against (Republican) Ronald Reagan at the end of the 1984 Democratic convention,\" Zogby said. Reagan won that race in a landslide.The results of the Reuter poll may differ slightly from some other recent surveys because of methodology, Zogby said. The Reuters poll excluded respondents if they were not registered to vote or said they were unlikely to vote.\"Our universe has to be those who show up to vote on election day. A lot of adults don't vote,\" Zogby said. Some other polls survey voting-age adults or registered voters.The poll was the second of three major surveys Zogby is conducting for Reuters.

If it is an invisible trade barrier, we may have to consider further steps,\" Hisashi Hosokawa, vice trade minister for international trade affairs, told a news conference.  \"Evidently the budget (for the supercomputer purchase) has been stopped...and not only Japanese companies but others will be inconvenienced,\" he said.U.S. supercomputer maker Cray filed a petition on July 29 with the Commerce Department alleging that NEC was selling supercomputers in the United States at less than fair prices.The U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research tentatively agreed on May 20 to buy four NEC supercomputer systems. But earlier this month the government-funded National Science Foundation, which is the primary funding agency, said it was withholding approval to buy these supercomputers until the dumping allegations were resolved.  \"We need more time to look into the detailed aspects of this matter,\" Hosokawa said, adding that any decision to take the case to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for dispute settlement would require Japan to be \"quite specific\" on the reasons for doing so.He said, however, that he did not mean to imply that Japan would necessarily take the case to the WTO.\"We are simply examining all the elements.

{"token": "Bauxite miner and aluminium and alumina producer Comalco Ltd is expected to report a sharp fall in its 1996 first half net profit on Monday, due to a stronger Australian dollar and a weaker aluminium price, analysts said.Australian aluminium analysts contacted by Reuters forecast Comalco to report a net profit before abnormals of between A$55 million and A$67 million for the six months to June 30, 1995, compared with A$155.1 million in the 1995 first half.The analysts also expected Comalco, 67 percent owned by RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd, to slash its first half dividend to about five or six cents from 12 cents a year ago.  \"The key factors are the aluminium price is lower, the A$ dollar is up, therefore in A$ terms it is going to be even lower. The volumes have been okay for the first half,\" said Peter O'Connor, a metals analyst at brokers Macquarie Equities.O'Connor forecast Comalco to report a net profit before abnormals of A$58.8 million in the 1996 first half and a five cent per share dividend payout.Analysts have been cutting Comalco's 1996 profit forecasts since the start of 1996 due to strength of the Australian dollar and the weakness of the aluminium price.  Comalco reported a 1995 year net profit of A$232.3 million. The three-month aluminium contract traded on the London Metal Exchange has fallen about 12.5 percent to a current level of 1,484.5 from 1,697.0 at the start of 1996, while the local dollar has strengthen nearly seven percent to about US$0.7900.Umit Safak at brokers James Capel expected Comalco to report a net profit before abnnormals of A$55 million for the half.\"I see the dividend being close to half of last year's,\" Safak told Reuters on Friday.  One Melbourne-based analyst forecast Comalco to produce a half-year net profit before abnormals of A$67 million, the upper end of expectations.A Sydney-based analyst said he expected Comalco to report a pre-abnormals net profit of between A$55 million to A$65 million for the six months.\"We are down at the lower end of that range (A$55-A$65 million),\" another Melbourne-based analyst said.  Despite the lower profit forecast, Comalco raised primary aluminium output 3.9 percent to 217,085 tonnes in the 1996 half. Analysts have trimmed back Comalco's earnings forecast for 1996 year profit in light of the aluminium price and strong local dollar, to around A$130 million from estimates of around A$255 million-A$265 million at the start of the year.Analysts said Comalco shares are looking fully-priced on the current 1996 outlook and most analysts recommended a short-term hold and long-term buy for the Melbourne-based group.  \"The share price is already priced on the basis of a return to much higher aluminium prices in 1997, 1998 and the market is anticipating that turnaround,\" one analyst said.At 2.30 p.m. (0430 GMT), Comalco shares were six cents lower at A$7.50 on light volume.

The Airbus A-310 airliner refuelled at Larnaca, Cyprus and landed at Stansted early on Tuesday.A thorough police search of the plane only uncovered knives and fake explosives, triggering questions as to whether the seven men were guerrillas or refugees.Police said the suspects -- some of whom brought their families with them -- could well have considered Britain a safe haven from the rule of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.A Home Office (interior ministry) spokeswoman said the seven were likely to face criminal charges before any asylum bids could be considered.\"Where a serious crime has been committed prosecution would generally follow first,\" she said by telephone. The maximum punishment for hijacking under British law is life imprisonment.Home Secretary Michael Howard can allow the suspects to stay in Britain if he thinks there are compelling humanitarian grounds but he is under pressure from right-wing members of parliament to deport them.\"Hijacking is a horrendous and sometimes murderous crime and hijackers must be dealt with the utmost severity,\" said David Howell, chairman of the lower house of parliament's foreign affairs committee.During the incident a member of the airline crew was heard telling the control tower that the seven men were not guerrillas or fundamentalists.\"They are ordinary people, they have been persecuted by Saddam regime. They need protection for their families,\" the unidentified crew member said.One of the men who staged the last hijack of an airliner to Britain in 1982 said he had cut a deal with Home Office officials which allowed him to stay after serving three years in jail.Yassin Membar, a Tanzanian dissident who hijacked an Air Tanzania jet to London, said it had been made clear that whatever happened he would not be sent home.\"(They said) if we were found guilty we would be sent to prison but we would not be sent back to Tanzania because we believed our lives would be in danger at that particular time,\" he told British television.", "label": ["CCAT", "GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

In September 1995, Slovakia temporarily abolished custom duties on the import of medium-sized cars, saying it would review the policy at the end of 1996 and that the main criterion in considering re-imposition of the tariffs would be country' foreign trade balance.The abolition of the duties was an attempt to aid Slovaks looking to buy medium-sized cars and help eliminate the number of older cars from the road.But the country's trade deficit has since ballooned, spurred in large part by the importing of new cars.Slovakia posted a trade deficit of 31.9 billion crowns in the January-July period this year, a reversal of the 1.8 billion crown surplus posted in 1995.Earlier this year the government decided to completely abolish a widely criticised import surcharge effective January 1, 1997 after heavy pressure from western economic organisations, such as the WTO and the European Union.-- Peter Laca, Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-210-3687", "label": ["C13", "C311", "C31", "CCAT", "E512", "E51", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

But their efforts were studded with delays and failures.In April, the Matif, the French stock markets authority SBF and Deutsche Boerse abandoned plans for a joint electronic trading system for shares and derivatives when the Germans opted not to use a French-developed system for trading shares.But they still planned more limited cooperation on interest rate contracts. The final blow came from German insistence that the Matif abandon \"open outcry\" for trading interest rate products. \"For the Germans, it had to be electronic or nothing,\" said the spokeswoman, saying they showed \"real dogmatism\".All other big centres which trade interest rate products use open outcry and it would have been too risky to change, she said. \"It's always delicate to change a system when market participants are used to it -- it might kill the contract.\"The Matif had placed a high priority on a German link-up but played it down after difficulties emerged. Matif head Gerard Pfauwadel told L'Agefi newspaper on Tuesday that interest rate products \"were the real challenge for the future...Paris remains a major place for interest rate products\".More than 80 percent of the Matif's trading volume is in interest rate contracts. When monetary union starts, Paris would enjoy advantages giving it \"critical mass in euros,\" he said.The French treasury has already said it plans to start issuing its securities in euros as of 1999 and that it will convert the whole stock of existing securities into the Euro.\"This will give the notionnel an underlying large criticial mass of securities denominated in euros,\" the Matif spokeswoman said. The notionnel is its flagship 10-year government bond contract, the second most heavily traded bond future in Europe after the German bund future traded on the London International Futures and Options Exchange, Europe's largest derivatives market.Still, the Matif faces a struggle for dominance against LIFFE. Matif's total trading volume slid 24 percent last year and were flat in the seven months to July while LIFFE's volumes were up 20 percent.The Matif has a working group developing a new strategy that will have its recommendations ready by year end.\"It would have seemed more satisfactory from a strategic point of view to create a common platform, it would have been one less competitor if we had allied with Germany,\" said the Matif spokeswoman. \"But the risk to be taken to achieve this was was far too high.\"", "label": ["M12", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Britain's Rentokil Group Plc on Thursday notched up a 35.6 percent rise in half-year profits and announced plans to change its name as it moves further away from its rat-catching past.Rentokil made a pre-tax profit of 134.5 million pounds in the six months to June 30, just at the bottom end of analysts' expectations.The name change follows the pest control-to-security group's victorious 2.1 billion pound ($3.25 billion) takeover of BET in April which brought a batch of new businesses under its control, including BET's Initial cleaning and washroom services brand.The firm now aims to be called Rentokil Initial Plc.Chief executive Sir Clive Thompson told Reuters the firm was not attempting to hide its famous Rentokil moniker. The name is sometimes seen as unsuitable now the firm has branched out far beyond pest control into things as diverse as tropical plants and hospital services.\"It is not an attempt to remove the Rentokil name. That name will still be very prominent,\" Thompson said in an interview.He added Initial would be used to cover the enlarged group's cleaning, hospital services, textile services and security operations. \"Rentokil will still be used where there is a need for an aggressive name to deal with a firm's problems,\" he added, citing pest control as an example.Rentokil's turnover more than doubled to 842 million pounds from 400.9 million and shareholders will receive an increased dividend of 1.48 pence up from 1.23 pence.The results include two months of trading from BET's businesses which contributed 344.3 million pounds to turnover and 15.1 million pounds to profits.Thompson has been dubbed \"Mr 20 Percent\" by admiring investors for a track record of delivering 14 years of annual profits and sales growth of 20 percent.He was under pressure to make good on his boast that this would continue even though Rentokil now had BET's businesses to tackle too.But his reputation was intact on Thursday as Rentokil said in a statement that even excluding the BET buy, the firm's first-half turnover rose 24.1 percent to 497.7 million pounds and profit increased by 20.4 percent to 119.4 million pounds.The firm's shares rose on the news to stand at 412 pence pence, up three pence in early morning trade.Thompson said the integration of BET was going well and the merger of the two headquarters operations had gone well with BET's central staffing going down from 139 to 40. Thompson said this should produce a full year saving of 20 million pounds.The two firms' cleaning businesses in the United States have already been put together and the European cleaning operations will not be far behind, Thompson said.Plans for the integration of hospital services and hygiene and health care are also well advanced, he said.During the bid Rentokil said it would consider the future of BET's plant services, conferencing and resort units.But Thompson told Reuters the firm had examined the whole group and now planned no major sales, though there might be some minor disposals. \"We have looked at those businesses and we believe that we can help them to grow and improve,\" he said.Before the BET bid Rentokil was majority owned by Danish firm Sophus Berendsen A/S.

Analysts had forecast Fortis, which is equally-owned by Fortis Amev and Fortis AG, to report a net profit of between 341 million and 371 million ecus.Yvette Van der Schaaf, director group reporting, said any acquisitions must meet the group's criteria of 12 percent return on equity per annum and seven to 12 percent growth in earnings per share.She did not rule out acquisitions in any area, but added, \"We like life and investment, where it's profitable of course...It depends on performance and price.\"  In Europe, Fortis' main markets are the Netherlands, Belgium and to a lesser extent Spain. In the UK Fortis has a non-life operation and in France a life company.In the U.S., Van der Schaaf said Fortis was taking measures to tackle the disappointing performance of its life business, which was in part due to cyclical factors.\"We are being very selective about what lines we want to be in and the way we handle them,\" she added.Fortis United States reported a 10 percent fall in operating profits to 45 million ecus. The health insurance result remained in the red but was up on the first quarter, the company said.

{"token": "Honda Motor Co Ltd announced on Friday that its first-quarter profits jumped by nearly 300 percent from a year earlier thanks to booming demand for recreational vehicles and a weaker yen.The increase prompted the automaker to raise its profit forecasts for the current business year.Honda's group net profit in the first quarter of the business year that started on April 1 jumped 283.4 percent from a year before to 45.71 billion yen ($423 million).\"The main reason for the profit increase was strong demand for recreational vehicles,\" managing director Kunihiro Chujo told Reuters.He also said group profits in the first quarter were pushed up by 25 billion yen ($231 million) due to the weaker yen, which averaged 107 yen to the dollar compared with 84.45 yen to the dollar a year earlier.Booming sales of recreational vehicles boosted operating profits by 50.6 billion yen ($468 million), the company said.But Chujo said the robust sales also increased sales costs by 37.1 billion yen ($343 million) in the quarter.Honda sold almost three times the number of CR-V recreational vehicles in Japan -- 26,492 -- it had targeted.Other recreational vehicles, such Step Wagons and Odysseys, exceeded their sales targets by 100 to almost 200 percent.Encouraged by the quarterly result, Honda raised its parent and group profit forecasts for the 1996/97 business year.It raised its forecast for group net profit to 160 billion yen ($1.48 billion) from its May forecast of 120 billion yen ($1.11 billion).In 1995/96, Honda posted actual parent current profit of 47.18 billion yen ($436 million) and group net profit of 70.8 billion yen ($655 million).Honda also announced that domestic production in July was up 18.5 percent from the same month a year ago while domestic sales were up 22.5 percent.It said in a statement said that its exports in July rose 14.7 percent year-on-year, and its overseas production was up 30.1 percent.\"Its production is exceeding projected levels, its U.S. sales are strong now and it will start exporting its CR-V to the U.S. That will contribute to its profit in the second half,\" Nomura Research analyst Seiji Sugiura said.\"Domestic demand for Honda cars has been so strong that I believe group profits could be larger than the already revised-up figure of 160 billion yen ($1.48 billion) this year,\" Sugiura said.Honda will start selling CR-Vs in the United States early next year and will resume exporting four-door Civics there later this year, another Honda official said.He said the Civic exports are needed because Honda's Ohio plant is operating at full capacity and cannot meet demand.Honda's sales in North America rose 14.6 percent from a year earlier to 457,912 in the January-July period due to strong demand for almost all its models, including U.S.-made Civics and the Japan-produced Acura TL luxury car.Overall North American automobile demand rose 3.9 percent to 8.41 million units in the same period.

{"token": "China announced on Thursday it was cutting bank deposit and lending rates in response to easing domestic inflation.But it also said the reduction, the second since May, did not mean a retreat from what it called \"appropriately tight monetary policies\".The central People's Bank of China said it would cut bank deposit rates by an average of 1.5 percentage points and lending rates by 1.2 percentage points, effective on Friday, according to the official media.New rates on basic savings accounts would be an annual 1.98 percent while fixed deposit rates would range from 3.33 percent for three-months to 9.0 percent for five years.Lending rates for operating funds would be cut to 9.18 percent for six months and 10.08 percent for one year while fixed asset loans would range as high as 12.42 percent for five years or more.The move follows a marked slowdown in the rate of inflation this year. Retail price inflation was 6.9 percent for the first seven months, well within the target of 10 percent for the full year, and a dramatic improvement from the 14.8 percent recorded for all of 1995.Officials said that in addition to the good news on the inflation front, they aimed to ease the interest rate burden of domestic companies, many of them cash-strapped state firms.\"The central bank has decided to cut interest rates in response to the fall in inflation and in an effort to ease the interest rate burden of the nation's enterprises,\" the Xinhua news agency said, quoting an unnamed central bank official.\"But this reduction in rates does not mean that the People's Bank has abandoned its policy of maintaining appropriately tight monetary policies,\" it said.Inefficient and cash-short state firms needed other means besides lower interest rates to resolve their problems, the agency added.China has said it needed to overhaul its state enterprises to make them better able to compete in the free market after years of allowing them to rely on state subsidies.Frederic Cho, a banker with Banque Indosuez, said the government believed the economy had slowed too fast and it needed to reignite the engine.\"This is a good moment. Inflation has come down and the government feels everything is under control. State firms and banks need something to improve their performance,\" he said.In a front-page commentary on Thursday, the China Securities newspaper said a rate cut was needed to stimulate flagging demand, provide state firms with much needed capital and reduce banks' debt burden.\"Looking at the current situation of the economy, conditions for a second interest rate cut are certainly ripe,\" it said.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Tambunan, Luhut Pangaribuan and Luthfie Hakim, said Singgih had made a number of public statements that the rights of those detained since the riots last month would be respected under the law.The United States, Australia and the European Union all urged Indonesia in the wake of the riots to follow due process in handling all those detained, including leader of the unrecognised Indonesia Labour Welfare Union (SBSI).But the lawyers said the attorney-general was ignoring the code, or KUHAP, a section of which gave an accused the right to be questioned, taken to court and, if found guilty, sentenced as soon as possible.\"The detention of Muchtar Pakpahan is premature. It shows the attorney-general is not sensitive enough to the rights of the accused in detention as guaranteed under the KUHAP,\" they said.The letter called on Singgih to complete the questioning as soon as possible and take Pakpahan's case to court. It also called for restrictions on his access to lawyers and family members to be lifted, and for Pakpahan to be allowed writing materials, sunlight and exercise for the sake of his health.Pakpahan was jailed in November 1994 for three years on charges of inciting riots in Medan that year.

The report could not immediately be confirmed.Radio Red quoted a police commander in the town of Tacambaro, about 50 miles (80 km) south of the state capital Morelia, saying some 40-50 men attacked the convoy.It was not clear if the attack was linked to a series of attacks by the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR) guerrilla group in three other Mexican states -- Oaxaca, Mexico and Guerrero -- on the night of Aug. 28.In a statement published on Friday in a local newspaper, the EPR called for a popular uprising.But the government said the guerrillas had no popular support, even though it acknowledged their presence in at least eight states. Talks with the rebels were not possible in the current situation, it said.The White House on Friday strongly condemned the rebel violence, but the State Department said it saw no threat to Mexican political or economic stability.\"We condemn the violent actions of what appears to be a very ruthless, small, armed organisation of obscure groups dedicated to the overthrow of the Mexican government,\" White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters travelling with President Bill Clinton on a campaign trip in Missouri.State Department spokesman Glyn Davies, praising Mexico's economic performance since the December 1994 peso crisis, added: \"It's important to underscore that the United States does not consider these actions threatening to Mexican political or economic stability.\"Nervous investors, attracted by higher U.S. interest rates and worried about political risk in Mexico, bailed out of Mexican stocks and drove the peso weaker in early trade.Mexican markets recovered most of the losses later. The peso closed 4.4 centavos weaker at 7.584 per dollar and the stock market ended 29 points, or less than one percent, lower.Deputy Interior Minister Arturo Nunez told international journalists the official death toll from the attacks was 13, although he added a severely wounded policeman might also have died since his last update.\"Security measures have been reinforced in the strategic installations of the country,\" Nunez said, listing oil and gas installations, telecommunications facilities and roads.Security forces would also be \"very alert\" on Sunday, when President Ernesto Zedillo is due to give his second annual State of the Nation address, he said.Nunez said officials calculated between 150 and 200 rebels had taken part in the attacks, but declined to say what proportion of the EPR's combatants that represented.He repeated the government's belief that the EPR was the armed wing of a clandestine radical group called the Worker and Campesino Revolutionary Party-Union of the People (PROCUP), which first appeared in the early 1970s.\"The hard core of the PROCUP would be about 50 people,\" he said, although he alleged that other radical organisations in different parts of the country were lending it their members for specific actions, some with no military training, to give an impression that the EPR is bigger than it really is.\"New actions cannot be ruled out by this group aimed at generating ... an image abroad of a destabilised Mexico, in a situation of turbulence and war, which does not correspond to the reality of the country,\" he said in an earlier TV interview.Nunez said the EPR had a presence in the states of Guerrero, Puebla, Oaxaca, Chiapas and the central state of Mexico and had also carried out propaganda actions in the eastern Huasteca area, which includes Hidalgo and Veracruz states.The attacks were the worst political violence in Mexico since the Zapatista rebellion in early 1994 in the southeastern state of Chiapas.", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Revenues rose 14.8 percent to $232.6 million from $202.6 million.Toro said its consumer product sales rose 33.9 percent during the quarter, led by extremely early sales of snow throwers and good performances from Toro's riding and electric product groups.A spokesman said snow throwers are usually shipped in the fourth quarter, but dealers wanted to have them available in August because of overwhelming demand over the past winter.Commercial product sales increased by 3.0 percent over the same period last year. International sales were strong and the domestic landscape contractor market continued to grow.Irrigation sales grew 3.7 percent, as Toro's strategy of selling do-it-yourself products through mass merchants continued to be successful. Sales to golf courses and residential contractors also rose.International sales increased by 15.5 percent due primarily to improving commercial sales to the European golf market.

{"token": "Lawyers for environmentalists and the sugar industry made their arguments before the Florida Supreme Court Thursday in a battle to put a penny-a-pound sugar tax referendum on the November ballot.For the second time in two years, the two sides met over a controversial tax proposal that would raise $750 million over its 25-year life for cleanup of Florida's Everglades.The courtroom was packed with supporters for both sides, and outside the Supreme Court building, proponents of the penny-a-pound tax chanted and waved signs.Environmentalists claim the sugar industry pollutes the Everglades by allowing fertiliser-tainted water to leech from cane fields into surrounding wetlands. Industry officials say the tax would be a death knell for the industry, threatening 16,000 jobs related to sugar production in southern Florida.Attorneys for Save Our Everglades, a Miami-based group backing three constitutional amendments, has garnered nearly 1.5 million signatures to put the propoals on the ballot.Opponents, including the Sugar Growers Cooperative of Florida and U.S. Sugar Corp., said the proposals merely mimic a 1994 amendment that the court said was unconstitutional, and therefore should be struck down again. But SOE said it had made changes to the 1994 proposal and the amendments will now stand up to Supreme Court muster.The court struck down the 1994 referendum on the grounds that it addressed too many issues within a single proposal. State rules demand that a ballot question be limited to a single issue to prevent special interests from making wholesale revisions to the constitution.The new package was divided into three separate amendments. One would establish a 1 cent-a-pound tax on raw sugar grown in southern Florida. The second would establish a trust fund and a third would make polluters pay for damage.In an hour-long hearing before the court Thursday, Chesterfield Smith, representing U.S. Sugar, said that Save Our Everglades was trying to circumvent the legislature by appealing directly to voters for constitutional change.\"They should be made to go elsewhere as the constitution intended,\" Smith said. \"But Save Our Everglades wants nothing less than a constitutional revision of the portions that affect the subject they are interested in.\"SOE attorneys countered that their revised proposal would affect a specific group of people and the money would be used for a specific purpose, two of the criteria required under Florida's procedures for revising the constitution.\"The opponents can ask you to ignore what is good policy for the Everglades and they can ask you to ignore what would be good for the taxpayers of Florida,\" said SOE attorney Jon Mills. \"But what they can't ask you to ignore is your own precedent on the constitution to require that they prove substantial impact in multiple areas.\"The court must only agree that each proposed amendment deals with a single subject and that the ballot summary accurately explains the impact of each proposal. The justices did not indicate when they would rule but the decision must be handed down within the next two months with the election scheduled for Nov. 5.", "label": ["C13", "CCAT", "E211", "E21", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM", "GENV", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The Balkan country now has 36 commercial banks, of which eight are branches of foreign banks.Currently only the state savings bank guarantees deposits.The decree did not indicate if it applied retrospectively but the central bank governor has said previously the scheme would not protect depositors in troubled private banks Dacia Felix SA and Renasterea Creditului Romanesc Credit Bank SA, whose holdings amount to some 280 billion lei ($88 million).Both of the medium-sized banks are now awaiting court decisions on their fate and are currently unable to repay depositors.

CAI's principals, who had won positions on Commercial Federal's board last year, sought the company's sale. They have now agreed to resign their board seats, Commercial Federal said.

The last of the takeover speculators could decide to blow out, but most of the people who bought this on takeover speculation have already given up,\" said Montgomery Securities analyst Caren Mayer.In sum, the deal is a plus for Commercial Federal because it reduces the number of outstanding shares, boosts earnings per share and removes uncertainty, Mayer said.  \"It's a positive for CFC stock because it works like a share repurchase,\" Mayer said. \"The negative is psychological because the investment community is no longer going to view this (Commercial Federal) as a takeover opportunity.\"The shares being reacquired -- about 8.3 percent of Commercial Federal's outstanding stock -- were bought by CAI some time ago.

But the benchmark index will not slip below 940 points and the interim resistance at 950 will be overcome,\" he said.The Athens general share index closed 0.31 percent, or 2.89 points higher at 948.55 from Wednesday's 945.66 close after opening at 945.61 points. Turnover rose to 11.07 billion drachmas on volume of 5.3 million shares.Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos has signed a decree ordering the dissolution of the 300-seat parliament ahead of early elections on September 22.Market watchers said stocks would consolidate around 940 points as players would now opt for undervalued issues that did not participate in the advance.

Nevertheless I am satisfied that the overall benefits will be worthwile,\" Lord Goschen, minister for aviation, said in a statement.The ministry said it believed the new limits could be met with existing aircraft. \"They can be flown in quieter ways,\" a spokesman said.The reduction in noise levels is the same as proposed in a consultation paper which was published in October 1995.The present noise levels have applied at Heathrow, one of the world's busiest airports, since 1959 and at Gatwick since 1968.The number of monitors will be increased and some will be repositioned to detect noisy planes.-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717", "label": ["C13", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GENV"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The London Stock Exchange launched its new integrated trading and information computer system, Sequence 6, on Tuesday, the last stage in a three-year programme to take the market into the next century.The new system will complete the introduction of electronic trading begun at the time of the \"Big Bang\" shake up of the London market in 1986 which ended business on the floor of the exchange.Sequence 6 will provide the basis for new electronic trading in the top blue-chip shares once the structure of a new order-driven trading regime is agreed and implemented in 1997.That will signal the end of the current, quote-driven system where prices are set exclusively by dealers authorised to act as \"market-makers\" and deals are struck over the telephone.It will also enable electronic as well as telephone-based trading in the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and the Seats -- Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service -- market for less liquid stocks.\"We are delighted that Sequence 6 has been implemented successfully, on time and under budget. The launch has gone very well today and the users appear to be very happy,\" said a spokeswoman for the exchange.However, some market-makers said they experienced problems in posting prices, citing difficulties with the Reuters system.A Reuters spokesman said the company's link to Sequence 6 was operating as planned but that there was an unrelated, temporary operational problem with feeds from several European exchanges including London which affected prices in the morning.The completion of the Sequence programme at a cost of 81 million pounds ($126 million) will help ensure that London retains its competitive edge and reduce costs for the market and its participants, the exchange said.During extensive testing over five weekends this summer, the new trading system succesfully coped with up to five times the average levels of daily activity in the London market, it added.The completion of the project, on time and nearly five million pounds ahead of budget, will come as a relief to the exchange after its ill-fated and costly attempt at building a paperless share-settlement system -- TAURUS -- was abandoned four years ago.The collapse of the project resulted in the resignation of then chief executive Peter Rawlins and subsequent involvement of the Bank of England in supervising the development of Crest, a replacement for the Exchange's antiquated Talisman system.It may also mark a turnaround in its fortunes after a year which began with the sacking of its chief executive, Michael Lawrence, amid disagreement over how to counter competition from markets abroad.

{"token": "The U.S. Federal Communications Commission gave television networks the green light on Wednesday to offer the major presidential candidates free air time during the autumn general election.The approval ensured that TV stations will give President Bill Clinton and Republican Bob Dole -- and quite possibly Reform Party candidate Ross Perot -- free access to the airwaves to make unfiltered pitches for why they should be president.The FCC said the proposals made by Fox, ABC, and the Public Broadcasting Service did not violate the \"equal time\" provisions of federal communications law.The agency also said the proposals represented \"on-the-spot coverage of 'bona fide' news events,\" and so are exempt from the requirement that TV stations give equal opportunity to all legally qualified candidates.The approval also placed added pressure on the networks to accept a proposal from a bipartisan group that wants to establish a standardised format for free broadcasts.\"The last hurdle is the major commercial networks and the big cable-TV operators,\" said Paul Taylor, chief advocate for the Free TV for Straight Talk Coalition.Taylor said the FCC decision \"clears away any regulatory underbrush\" that could have thwarted the group's proposal for candidates to deliver 10 made-for-TV mini speeches 2-1/2 minutes in length during the last month of the campaign.Clinton and Dole generally accepted the proposal, which was similar to the PBS plan. But ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and CNN did not agree to set aside the uniform blocks of time required, instead opting to push their own formats.\"I hope this ruling will encourage our commercial television colleagues to join us in broadcasting these appearances at the same time each weeknight,\" said PBS President Ervin Duggan.Sens. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat, have invited network executives to meet with the Free TV/Straight Talk coalition and work out a standard format. A meeting was scheduled for Sept. 10. Network representatives were expected to attend.Rupert Murdoch was the first to ask the FCC for permission to allow his Fox network to provide free time to \"major\" candidates without giving minor or fringe candidates the same opportunity.Campaign-reform advocates supported the free-time concept, charging that attack ads and 10-second sound bites on the evening news were superficial and poisoned the political process.The FCC said it was relying on broadcasters' discretion and good faith news judgments, stressing that the proposals must include reasonable safeguards against broadcaster favouritism.The Fox proposal was for a one-hour programme on the eve of the Nov. 5 election, in which time would be split evenly among candidates selected for inclusion by an independent panel. Fox also proposed 10 60-second slots devoted to election issues.ABC proposed a one-hour prime-time programme in the last week of the campaign, with the candidates appearing together without interruptions from a third party.", "label": ["C13", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Laurence Summers Friday said a goal for central banks of 1 to 3 percent inflation \"looks about right.\"\"One to three percent inflation is probably a reasonable goal,\" Summers said at an international symposium here on \"Achieving Price Stability.\"  The U.S. Treasury official was expressing general support for the target range suggested by Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, who spoke earlier at the symposium.Summers did, however, caution against overly rigid approaches to inflation targeting.He cited the example of the 1987 stock market crash to point out that there are some circumstances where aiming to achieve low inflation would not be the only important consideration for central banks deciding monetary policy.  Summers also said that while countries like the United States operate with flexible exchange rates, \"I think it is reasonable to assert that in at least some circumstances monetary policy may need to respond to exchange-rate fluctuations.\"He stressed that his remarks about monetary policy were not intended in any way as comments on the actions of the Federal Reserve. He cited a policy of the Clinton Administration not to comment on Fed policy.  One danger is that it could cause cyclical downturns to last too long, he said.Summers also agreed with Fischer's earlier remarks in which he expressed concern about the complications for monetary policy when it might be necessary to engineer negative real interest rates.Turning to tools that could aid monetary policy in the United States, Summers said that Treasury's decision to issue inflation-indexed bonds could be helpful.Summers said the issuance would reduce government's incentive to inflate and would also provide a market-based measure of inflation expectations.Commenting on the same subject earlier, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed skepticism about how useful inflation-indexed bonds would be in gauging inflation expectations.", "label": ["E12", "E131", "E13", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Germany's Audi AG, seeking to expand its international presence, said on Thursday it will announce in a few years plans for two or three foreign finishing plants but has ruled out a U.S. plant for now.\"You can be sure that plans for two or three new plants will announced in the next few years,\" Audi management board chairman Herbert Demel said in an interview with Reuters.Demel said Brazil, where parent company Volkswagen has extensive operations, and India were \"interesting candidates\" but said there would be no new plant in the U.S. before 2000.\"We are thinking about several potential sites, but we could imagine building where VW is currently located,\" he said.The Ingolstadt-based luxury carmaker earlier on Thursday said group pre-tax profit rose 58 percent to 405 million marks ($273.8 million) as foreign sales expanded amid a downturn in the German market.Audi said worldwide sales rose to 9.3 billion marks from 8.2 billion marks in the 1995 period as 246,597 vehicles were sold, a rise of 6.3 percent over the 1995 six-month period.Foreign vehicles sales rose to 55 percent of total sales from 51 percent in year-ago period, reflecting strong demand.But sales in Germany fell 2.1 percent to 110,262 vehicles.The carmaker, invigorated by its award-winning A4 vehicles, said however that its share of the German car market in the first half of the year fell to 5.8 percent from 6.4 percent.Demel said Audi's nominal German market share would likely fall in 1996 to about six percent from 6.3 percent in 1995.But he expected 1996 sales to climb more than five percent with return on sales topping the 1995 level and said 1996 would be \"a strong year\" in Germany. He noted that 1995 was \"an even stronger year\" in the domestic market due to the new the A4.Despite the foreign expansion, Demel said Audi was commited to Germany and would build a new German paint factory by 1999 that will have a minimum investment of 300 million marks.\"We want to do everything to build as many Audis in Germany as possible and also build as many vehicles in foreign countries as needed,\" he said.But Demel said, \"One must build cars as close to the market as possible. You cannot supply markets in South America or Asia only from Ingolstadt.\"Brazil is widely rumoured to be the top site for a plant to build the new compact A3 sedan, modeled on the platform of the VW Golf. Top Audi officials have said potential A3 production in Brazil could reach about 25,000 to 30,000 vehicles per year.Audi is eyeing the South American market as a lucrative region to sell the three-door vehicle, which fills a void at the lower price range of the carmaker's premium product line. The European launch of the A3 is set for early September.Demel declined to predict potential investment in new plants, which would likely assemble car pieces from other countries, but said it would likely be self-financed.The foreign expansion is also aimed at reducing Audi's exposure to the strong mark, which burdened 1995 profits by about 300 million marks. Demel said he did not expect any burden on its 1996 results from currency market volatility.The A3 comes at an important time for Audi since Demel said he expected actual production of A4 saloon and estate cars to peak in 1996 after about 270,000 vehicles in 1995. He also dismissed speculation Audi planned an even smaller vehicle.The A3 is expected to account for 20 percent of total Audi output by 1998. It plans 100,000 of the vehicles this year.Demel downplayed concerns about the A3 taking eating into sales of the A4 or the VW Golf. \"There is always going to be some overlap when one introduces a new model,\" Demel said.But he did not expect the same sort of dramatic growth spurt in sales seen after the A4 was introduced.\"The positioning of the Audi brand name in the market is more important than volume growth,\" he said. \"We want the A3 to play the role of drawing in younger and more dynamic buyers into the Audi premium product line.\"($1=1.4791 Mark)", "label": ["C11", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "A no-load mutual fund firm has launched a sweepstakes on the World Wide Web where parents can take a chance on winning a fund account to help pay their children's college costs.\"We want to show parents that investing even as little as $100 a month, if they start early enough, can help then pay for their child's education,\" said Stanley Egener, president of fund firm Neuberger & Berman.The \"College Starter Sweepstakes\" at the Web site will run through Nov. 30 and give parents a shot at winning a no-load mutal fund account valued at $1,200.To enter, the parent must fill out a college planning worksheet and an on-line entry form. The firm will deposit $100 a month for 12 months into a custodial account in the name of the child of the winner. The parent can pick the fund of his or her choice.Three winners will be chosen at random in December, the company said. The Web site's address is http://www.nbfunds.com.    The contest was announced in conjunction with the release of the results of a study the firm commissioned that showed parents are saving very little for their children's college costs.Of 1,000 parents surveyed with children under 13 years old in May, more than one-third could not even guess what it would cost to send their children to college. Of those who tried to guess, two-thirds underestimated the cost and half of those were off by 50 percent or more, the company said.The survey showed that parents who have started a savings plan for college costs are only saving about half or less then they will need for college bills.And those bills will be staggering for some people.By the time the class of 2010 enters college, the estimated cost for tuition, room, board and other expenses for a full four years will be $87,000 for a public school and $185,000 for a private school, based on data from the College Board Annual Survey of Colleges.Parents who haven't started saving will need to invest $360 a month per child for a public school and $767 a month for a private college, according the college planning worksheet available at the fund's Web site.", "label": ["C31", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Ethiopia said on Saturday floods had forced 50,000 people to leave their homes when the Awash river burst its banks and flooded sugar estates and other land.The state Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission said 40,000 people left the Methara, Shoa and Wonji sugar estates hit by floods when a dam released large amounts of water.It said another 10,000 people threatened by floods in the Afar region to the east were also moved to higher ground.The commission said floods damaged irrigated agricultural projects and plantations in the upper and lower Awash valley, a centre for cash crops such as cotton, fruit and vegetables, but gave no estimate of the cost.One person was killed when the river burst its banks in central Ethiopia on August 23.The commission said the government was trying to protect people threatened by high water levels in Lake Tana and Lake Awasaa in the south which were likely to flood because of heavy rain.Authorities said on Friday Ethiopia would import sugar to meet a significant shortfall caused by the Awash river flooding the three sugar estates but it did not indicate how much.Independent estimates put annual production from the three factories at around 220,000 tonnes -- an amount which meets Ethiopia's domestic demand and with a small surplus for export.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIS", "GENV"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "European bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with London clawing back most of the day's losses despite an unsteady start on wall Street, hit by inflation worries.The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over Tokyo's monetary direction ahead of the important Japanese Tankan economic survey out on Wednesday. But it recovered at the close of trade.Stocks in London started the week badly after a three-day weekend, slipping 0.3 percent, but bargain-hunters later moved in and the FTSE index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground.Tuesday's patchy showing in London followed a string of records last week, culminating in Friday's trading high of 3,911, fuelled by a wave of European interest rate cuts. The London bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on Wall Street, which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears, pulling U.S. Treasuries back from their early peaks.Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to 109.4 in August from a revised 107.0 in July, Wall Street relinquished virtually all its morning gains.\"Treasuries remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we're still in that summer doldrum period of light trading,\" said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock & Co. \"Consequently, stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings.\"Frankfurt was the one bright spot in Europe. Floor trading ended up 0.25 percent and the computerised IBIS index climbed nearly 0.4 percent, given a push by the performance of chemical shares. \"The market is trading 100 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it's all company news,\" said one trader.French shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc, dealers said.Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at 3.4210 per mark for the first time since August 13 as worries about the government's autumn budget and a weak U.S. currency lifted the mark and squeezed French investments.The dollar, which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the Japanese Tankan survey, weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday's levels.\"Besides the Tankan, there's nothing really until the U.S. jobs numbers next week,\" said a UK bank corporate dealer. \"There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market.\"Foreign exchange markets regard the Tankan report as an important indication of the country's future monetary policy direction. If it points to weakness in the economy, the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in Japanese interest rates will evaporate.The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent.The dollar was also pressured by the mark's strength against European currencies amid renewed concerns over Europe's economic and monetary union (EMU) timetable.CURRENCIESThe dollar was at 1.4788 marks and 107.74 yen at the close of European trading compared with 1.4789 marks and 107.55 yen on Monday.STOCK MARKETSThe Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares ended 1.8 points lower at 3,905.7.In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished down 2.43 at 2,017.99.The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 6.48 at 2,558.84.PRECIOUS METALSGold closed at $388.55 an ounce, compared with Monday's close of $388.75 on international markets.

{"token": "Computer Associates International Inc. is expected to unveil Monday a new Internet division that promises to save businesses from the headaches of seeking numerous vendors now needed to set up and manage a Web site.The company, which manages Web sites for large corporate customers, also plans to sign up hundreds of thousands of small businesses to use the service whether they own computers or not, sources close to the company said.In this \"community\" Internet service, neighbourhood businesses such as pizza parlours would contract with Computer Associates to establish an Internet presence, allowing customers to call up a shop's Web site to place an order.Currently, a company wishing to establish itself on the the Internet is confronted with a maze of separate vendors from which they must buy the necessary hardware, software and consultanting services to put together the disparate elements.The aim of Computer Associates' one-stop Internet service would be to shoulder all the messy technical responsibilities for customers, allowing them to focus on their own business.\"Computer Associates wants to ride the electronic commerce wave that is coming down the pike,\" said one source familiar with the CA Internet unit strategy. \"CA will provide a company the capacity for electronic commerce (on Web) sites in return for a revenue-sharing arrangement.\"Although not nearly so well known as Microsoft Corp. and other brand name PC software makers, Computer Associates is the world's top mainframe software supplier and the second largest independent software firm overall after Microsoft.Launching the new business unit is one of several major announcements the company is expected to make at its three-day CA World conference that started Sunday in New Orleans.In addition, Islandia, N.Y.-based Computer Associates has slated separate press conferences with Microsoft, Intel Corp. and Tandem Computers Inc. Monday and Tuesday.Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech Tuesday evening that is likely to centre on the further integration of Consumer Associates and Microsoft software strategies.Computer Associates declined to comment on announcements that may be in the works. Specifically, officials would not discuss plans to launch a separate Internet business unit.But sources familiar with Consumer Associates' plans confirmed that the new Internet unit has been formed to help customers create dynamic Web sites tied to internal corporate database systems.A special focus would be to make customer information stored on legacy mainframe systems available via the Web.Web-based electronic commerce tools would tie the system directly to a company's back-office accounting department.The division will account for only a few hundred out of Computer Associates' 9,000 total employees, the sources said.The planned business, which has been in the works since April, would be a natural extension of CA's systems management and database products target its existing customer base of the world's largest corporations, as well as smaller firms.In the pizza parlour example, a customer order would be routed over Computer Associates computers to the local pizza parlour, which would bake the pizza, bill the customer's credit card account and then deliver the order.Customer data storage would be hosted on Consumer Associates mainframes, an unusual feature compared to the hundreds of other Web service providers, who tend to leave information management in the hands of customers once Web site development work is complete.In effect, Computer Associates' plans would resurrect mainframe time-sharing, where in companies rent time on remote computers and pay service providers to assume responsibility for the headaches of managing the systems.Computer Associates stock, which has been trading at historic highs recently, rose $1 to close at $58.25 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.", "label": ["C22", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The majority of them are raising less than HK$100 million in the market,\" said Michael Ng, analyst at ASG Brokerage.Analysts said market sentiment had improved in Hong Kong now that fears of higher interest rates had subsided, resulting in a more favourable listing environment.\"An overall improvement in market sentiment has fuelled more new listings,\" said Tony Yung, research director from Tai Fook Securities. \"The market is expected to favour the China-play new listings, especially ahead of the 1997 handover.\"Hong Kong will revert to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997.China-concept stocks -- Hong Kong companies with substantial business interests in China -- have become a focus in the British territory with investors hoping to cash in on a recovery in the Chinese economy.Analysts said overseas investors preferred them to the less transparent H-share firms. H-shares are stocks of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong.Glorious Sun Enterprises Ltd, which is expected to issue 250 million new shares, or 25 percent of the expanded share capital, at between HK$1.40 and HK$1.60 per share, is tipped as one of the favourite China-concept plays, analysts said.The casual wear maker and retailer has over 400 outlets in China and also has a toehold in Australia.\"It is likely to attract a strong response, especially from investment funds, because of its China play concept and strong fundamentals. It has a huge distribution network in China,\" Ng said.Analysts expected the public offering to begin in early September and the share listing in mid-September.\"It would not be surprising for the issue to have a subscription rate of 50 to 60 times in view of the encouraging response so far in the market,\" Ng added.Analysts said other impending issues such as China Resources Enterprise Ltd's China Resources Beijing Land Ltd -- a pure China property play -- and Taiwanese sport shoe maker Pegasus Group, should also do well due to sound fundamentals.Pegasus Group is expected to raise about HK$1.5 billion to HK$2.0 billion in a public offering.Despite market caution towards H-shares, analysts expect a couple of Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong during the months ahead. Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical and Shenzhen Expressway are both attempting to raise funds, analysts said.\"Response towards new H-shares listings is expected to be cautious because the recent poor earnings reports from some H-share companies dampened sentiment a bit,\" said Kinson Au, senior analyst at PW Asia Brokerage.Meanwhile, analysts said Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd's long-awaited listing is expected to be pushed to the first quarter of 1997, giving way to the China Eastern Airlines flotation.The Shanghai-based airline is planning to list in Hong Kong and the United States by the end of the year, becoming the first Chinese airline to list its shares abroad.China Southern Airlines is also expected to list early next year after China Eastern, analysts said.", "label": ["C14", "C171", "C17", "CCAT", "M11", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Pakistan, striving to cut its budget deficit and shore up its balance of payments, has made a shaky start to fiscal 1996/97 (July-June), a former commerce minister (corrects portfolio of minister to commerce from finance throughout) said on Thursday.\"I'm very concerned,\" Hafiz Pasha, director of Karachi University's Institute of Business Administration, told Reuters.He said Pakistan might face a payments crunch in the next few months similar to one last October when the rupee was devalued seven percent against the dollar. \"It could happen again,\" he said in an interview.Pasha, who served as commerce minister in an interim government led by Moeen Qureishi in 1993, said uncertainty persisted over the budget announced in June.The government had imposed new taxes to raise over $1 billion, but nearly two months later was still negotiating with interest groups, some of which had won tangible concessions.\"They should have done all the bargaining before the budget,\" he said. \"What has happened since then has affected the government's credibility domestically and internationally.\"The International Monetary Fund has indicated that it will not send a mission to discuss the budget until Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government sorts out the budget confusion.The IMF will not release the third tranche of a $600 million standby loan, which should have been disbursed in June, until the team completes its review for the IMF board to consider.The budget aims to reduce the deficit to four percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996/97. Pasha said the protracted tax haggling had made this target more difficult to achieve.Last year's deficit was provisionally put at five percent of GDP, but Pasha said the final figure was likely to be in the 5.5 to 6.0 percent range, well above the 4.6 percent pledged to the IMF in December as a condition for the standby loan.Pasha, citing experience of the previous two years, said the new taxes might not yield substantial extra revenue \"because of implementation problems or because the economy is really not strong enough to absorb these doses of additional taxation\".Government borrowing remained high and the end-June figure was \"way above\" that published in budget documents, said Pasha, who sits on the State (central) Bank of Pakistan (SBP) board.Exports fell to $567 million in July, 43.5 percent down on the $1.003 billion registered in June, while imports declined 23.7 percent to $838 million from $1.098 billion.Industrial growth was virtually stagnant, despite this year's security improvement in the commercial hub of Karachi.Stop-go tariff reform had created apprehension for investors and the tariff structure had been distorted, with minimum rates being raised to maximise revenue, even as top rates came down.\"In Pakistan we have failed to understand that customs duties are there for protection, not for revenue,\" Pasha said.Lack of visible improvement in the balance of payments has put pressure on the rupee, with a gap of about nine percent opening up between the SBP rate and the unofficial rate.\"This is not sustainable. It encourages commodity imports and beyond some point you have to close this gap,\" Pasha said.He predicted that the central bank would speed up its \"crawling peg\" depreciation of the rupee against the dollar, but said it was no longer clear whether this approach would work.He said there was no sign yet of capital flight, partly because rates of return on foreign exchange deposits in Pakistan compare favourably to those offered elsewhere.\"But it's something that hits you very quickly. It's impossible to predict. But there is this underlying expectation that it will happen and that's what worries me,\" he said.Pasha said he believed that the official inflation rate, running at 10.2 percent year-on-year to July, was understated.He shared public perceptions of unfair tax collection. \"The biggest inequity in the tax system, something so glaring that it erodes tax morality, is the feeling that the richest people get away, particularly the feudal (landowner) class,\" he said.", "label": ["E11", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Last year, growth was 35 percent,\" Compaq's Consumer Group vice president, Toon Bouten, said in an interview.Last month, the Context research company said European personal computer sales in the three months ended June 30 were 10.4 percent above the same period last year at 3.58 million.Compaq was the market leader with 12.1 percent, followed by International Business Machines Corp.'s 9.7 percent and Hewlett-Packard with 5.4 percent.Bouten said the slowing sales growth was largely due to a lack of consumer confidence in Germany, Europe's biggest market.German consumers, worried by the economic outlook late last year, quickly switched to saving from spending. Confidence should return during the fourth quarter, Bouten said.Personal computer sales exploded across the world in the '90s. About 35 percent of American households now have computers; the figure is about 20 percent in Europe.Industry experts say that most sales represent purchases by businesses and the computer-literate, who perhaps work in the industry or use computers at work.These individuals can handle quirky high-technology machines, which often \"crash\" and present frustrated users with impossibly jargon-ridden instructions.The personal computer industry is investing heavily to produce new machines which are easier to use.

{"token": "Finnish commentators fully expect the markka to be linked to Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism, but while some expect a move very soon others think authorities will wait at least until after an October election.\"It is completely clear that the markka will be linked,\" said Risto Uimonen, editorial writer at daily Helsingin Sanomat. \"All the time the question has been one of when, not whether.\"A markka-ERM link was unlikely shortly before the October 20 local government and European parliament polls, analysts said.Of 10 observers polled by Reuters on Tuesday and Wednesday, four expected an early decision and five thought it would come later. One said a decision could come before or after elections.\"Their choice is September or November. I think they would rather go in early than late,\" said one political insider, adding speculative pressures might increase if the widely anticipated decision failed to materialise.But ABB Treasury Center Finland president Kenneth Stenberg said chances of a post-election move were growing and financial markets would not mind being kept waiting.\"It is starting to look more likely after (the election),\" he said. \"The market is absolutely sure that the ERM link is coming ... (waiting) is no problem. Strong confidence in the markka and in Finnish convergence will hold,\" he added.Those advocating a decision later said going for a peg prior to the elections might put ammunition in the hands of the opposition to Finland's five-party ruling coalition.Speaking on condition of anonymity, one veteran observer of Finnish politics said \"plenty of nationalistic chauvinism\" was involved in linking the markka to the ERM.Populists may try to use this to put government parties in an unfavourable light, he said. \"They (the government) are hardly eager to voluntarily promote that,\" he said.Esko Seppanen, a Leftist Alliance MP and outspoken critic of the ERM and Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) gave one example:A peg would be evidence of \"allegiance to Germany\" and would \"rob us of the possibility to ourselves affect the exchange rate\", said Seppanen, who also sits on the Bank of Finland's board of parliamentary supervisors and is a candidate Euro MP.He said he expected a link after the elections.Another central bank supervisory board member, Kimmo Sasi of the Conservative Party, also expected a move after the polls.\"My view is that it is unlikely that a decision would be made before, but the important thing is that when it is made it is based on economic reasons, not political,\" Sasi said.\"But from the government's point of view it might be politically inappropriate to decide on a link, say just two or three weeks before the elections,\" he said.The Bank of Finland's role in a link must not be ignored, some analysts said. Though independent on monetary policy, it must work with government on a markka-ERM decision.Central bank officials have repeatedly pointed out that the markka is stable already, and warned an ERM link may expose the currency to more speculative forces.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "G15", "G154", "GCAT", "M13", "M132", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "German construction group Philipp Holzmann AG, which last year posted a surprising loss due to writedowns on property holdings, on Tuesday presented a gloomy outlook for 1996 after a difficult first half.The company said it hoped simply to break even in the full 1996 year, saying that it would have to dissolve some hidden reserves to offset a negative operating result.\"For 1996, the company is aiming to post a break-even result by raising additional income through dissolving hidden reserves,\" Holzmann said in a statement.\"These additional profits will offset a negative operating result, possible losses from early sales of its properties and writedowns on financial holdings as a result of the streamlining of its portfolio,\" the statement added.Holzmann ran into huge financial problems in 1995, posting an unexpected loss of 443 million marks ($297.4 million) which forced it to omit its dividend payout. At the root of its problems were 458 million marks of writedowns on its property portfolio.Its shares -- which closed today at 375 marks, down from a February high of 685 marks -- were pushed sharply lower by the news, and by the resignation on old age grounds of finance director Michael Westphal soon after the losses were revealed.Today's forecasts for the full year represent a further worsening of its position.Only eight weeks ago, Holzmann management board chairman Lothar Mayer told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting that the company would do all it could to report a positive operating result for 1996.Holzmann said today that general weakness in the construction sector had not helped its position. Weak building activity weighed on the German economy at the turn of the year and improvement has been only slow.\"Business development in the first six months was severely affected by the difficult situation in the construction economy and the unusually harsh winter in mid-Europe,\" Holzmann said.Reporting on the first half of this year, Holzmann said its construction output fell by 4.6 percent to 5.9 billion marks.Orders in hand rose to 15.6 billion marks at mid-year from 13.5 billion at the end of 1995, while new business rose by 11 percent in the period, it said.Its general building division and transport construction group had negative operating results due to the long winter and losses at some groups in which Holzmann holds stakes.The service division, which was the main victim of the company's property problems, reported a negative result overall although its operations not connected with the problems were profitable, the statement said.However, the energy and environmental technology division was able to match its good 1995 result.Looking ahead to 1997, Holzmann remained pessimistic, predicting a further drop in construction volumes in Germany and Europe. It said it aimed to beat this by gaining strength in Asia and America.\"Output losses must be borne in the short term to enable us to reap better results,\" it said.($1=1.4895 Mark)", "label": ["C152", "C15", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Contract talks between Inco Ltd's Manitoba division and the union representing the nickel giant's Thompson division workers are turning to monetary issues as the union holds a strike vote today, the union said on Thursday.United Steelworkers of America local 6166 president Bob Desjarlais said he expects the local's 1,327 members to give the union a strong mandate to strike if a collective agreement is not reached by September 15, when the current three-year contract expires. Results of the strike vote will be known by about 2200 EDT/0200 GMT, he said.  Inco produces about one hundred million pounds (corrects from one million pounds) of nickel a year from the Thompson area in northern Manitoba.Desjarlais said the sides have made it through \"a very heavy agenda\" so far and are preparing to turn to monetary issues. He said major issues include pensions, wages, benefits and health and safety.\"Both sides have made some gains with this round of bargaining as far as collective agreement language changes are concerned,\" Dejarlais said. \"I feel very confident that we're going to get a good collective agreement.\"  Inco said the talks, which began in July, are going well but will likely go down to the wire.\"They always do,\" said Inco spokesman Bob Purcell. He dismissed the notion that languishing nickel prices would hamper a settlement.\"We don't have any problems with the talks and we don't have any problems with the nickel price,\" said Purcell.Desjarlais said the idea that Inco cannot afford to offer a good settlement because of the price of nickel, which has recovered slightly in the past week, or high production costs is laughable.  \"The price of nickel was used as a hammer to beat up the union in the last round of bargaining, but our members are not buying that ridiculous argument now,\" said Desjarlais. He said Inco is trying to influence this round of bargaining with complaints about cost problems in the division. \"If the Manitoba division costs may be up a little bit, it's a direct result of management decisions that we have no control over. And they are still making good profits in Manitoba.\"Analyst Manford Mallory of Research Capital Corp in Toronto said Inco's Manitoba division is considered a medium-cost producer.", "label": ["C42", "CCAT", "E41", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GJOB"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

No one can have privileges,\" he said.The government announced late Tuesday that it was banning Maxus from continuing its operations in Ecuador until it reaches a joint-venture deal with state-owned Petroecuador. Maxus, which has been operating fields near the Colombian border for the past nine years, is the only one of the foreign companies producing Ecuadoran oil which does not have a production-sharing agreement with the government. It has been engaged in tough negotiations over new contract terms.Adoum said the government has pressed Maxus several times to sign a contract but the firm, which is a unit of Argentina's largest energy concern YPF SA, has put off taking a decision.\"Maxus has been reluctant, giving 1,000 excuses,\" he said. Ecuadoran law requires foreign firms to grant the state a share equivalent to at least 12.5 percent of its output.Insisting that \"we are not going to let them rob us\", Adoum said the Ecuadoran government will fight any potential court action by Maxus.\"Up to now, we have paid Maxus $800 million in terms of all the infrastructure installed to extract the oil .... Up to now Maxus has extracted 50 million barrels of oil which with the sale price makes more or less $600 million,\" said Adoum.\"Up to now, the Ecuadoran people has not had a taste of one single liter of oil extracted by Maxus,\" he said. While local Maxus officials refused to comment, sources in the Ministry of Defense told Reuters that military personnel were already guarding Maxus's sites.Mark Miller, executive vice-president of Maxus, said in New York that the company hopes to have something to say about its problems with the government in the next couple of days.(Corrects to clarify that the company does not yet know when problems will be resolved).Maxus's Ecuadoran estimated reserves were 228 million barrels in 1992, ranking second only to Petroecuador. It began producing heavy oil in 1994 at a rate of 14,000 barrels a day. Among the other foreign oil companies operating in Ecuador are France's Elf Aquitaine, Repsol of Spain and ARCO (Atlantic Richfield Co ) of the United States.Ecuador, which left the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1992, produced 379,437 barrels of oil a day in 1995, up from 371,632 barrels a day the year before.-- Quito Newsroom +5932 258-433", "label": ["C11", "C13", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Other brokers and funds revealed increased Hong Kong weightings of at least 25 percent with some above 30 percent.The colony reverts to China at midnight on June 30, 1997, but analysts did not cite the date as an issue.Much of the optimism derives from China's aggressive rate cut on Thursday and the decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to leave U.S. rates unchanged.\"The United States isn't going to raise rates and probably won't this year and China cut rates more aggressively than even we were expecting,\" said Christopher Wood, Asian strategist for Peregrine Brokerage.\"It's all extremely positive for Hong Kong.\"Hill Samuel's Nicholas said upward revisions in earnings estimates for many Hong Kong companies following strong interim results added gloss to the market's relatively inexpensive valuations, such as a price-to-earnings ratio of about 12.\"I don't think it's cheap, but it's not too demanding,\" he said. \"Add that to a squeeze on margins around the region and the debate over whether the slowdown in export growth is structural or cyclical, and Hong Kong looks good.\"European and Asian funds had been buying actively, he said.

{"token": "Five Burmese democracy activists recently jailed for seven years were being punished for fabricating reports about the nation's rice harvest, Burma's embassy in Thailand said in a report.The five were trying to trick the United Nations into believing that farmers were forced to work on agriculture projects that had failed, the embassy said in a letter to the Bangkok Post newspaper published on Sunday.The letter explaining the sentencing of the five and three others, imprisoned on separate charges, came as Burma's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi accused the military of intensifying its oppression of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party.Win Htein, one of Suu Kyi's aides, was among the five imprisoned for allegedly falsifying reports on the problem-hit rice harvest.\"Under the instruction of Win Htein some NLD members, former members and local were sent out to collect information on agricultural developments,\" the embassy letter said.Two of Win Htein's team had \"deliberately sent false information ... to Ms Suu Kyi's residence\", it said.\"Similiary, Hla Tun Aung and Kan Sien ... recorded with a video camera some few plots where summer paddy was not growing well,\" it said, naming two of Win Htein's team.\"This was done with the intention of showing the recorded tape to Ms Suu Kyi and the NLD executive committee .... so that they can trick (United Nations organisations) into believing that the farmers are forced to work in a project which was a total failure,\" the letter said.Diplomats in Rangoon say the ruling military was highly sensitive about the local price of rice while at the same time was trying to boost rice exports to earn more foreign exchange.For several years, the government has been instructing farmers to grow two or three rice crops a year and authorities have also tried to increase rice production by expanding irrigation.In many areas villagers have been ordered to work, for little if any pay, to build irrigation systems, the diplomats say.Since last year, Burma's rice harvest has been badly hit by pests, which, according to some experts, could be a result of the new multiple cropping.\"In 1995 and 1996, Burma's paddy production began to be adversely affected by infestation of small insects that eat the rice kernel inside of the paddy husk,\" the U.S. embassy in Rangoon said in a recent report.\"This infestation is thought by some agricultural experts to be associated with multiple cropping of paddy, which may provide a continuous food supply for paddy-eating insects whose numbers had previously been limited by the absence of paddy during much of the year,\" the U.S. report said.Burma was one of Asia's leading rice exporters until a 1962 military coup and the subsequent introduction of isolationist, socialist-style economic policies.The current ruling military council introduced economic reforms after it was set up in 1988 and Burma exported slightly more than one million tonnes of milled rice in the 1994/95 financial year, which runs from April 1 to March 31, according to government figures.Industry sources and diplomats estimate some 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes was exported in the subsequent year.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIP", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Vintage surfboards became hot collectibles in the late 1980s, their value rising as Baby Boomers paid up for a piece of lost youth and museum curators eyed their beauty and cultural symbolism.Boards in top condition from around 1967 and earlier rose from garage sale giveaway prices to thousands of dollars today, especially those ridden by champions or hand-shaped by respected craftsmen.The Malibu Perpetual Surfboard, made of redwood in 1948 in California, was retrieved from a wood pile in 1979 but is unavailable today at any price -- a bid of $25,000 having been turned down.Prices accelerated quickly for about five years but leveled off around 1994, though the rarest boards and ones in mint condition continue to appreciate.With the sport's popularity growing on coastlines around the world and with many boards set aside in collections, prices are destined to rise again, top collectors say.\"There are not as many boards out there any more. But it seems that around Christmas and tax time I get pretty good deals because people sell some\" for needed cash, said Tim Dion, manager at Beckers Surf Shop in Malibu, Calif.Surfboards evolved from wooden planks to high-performance boards. Duke Kahanamoku, a champion swimmer from Hawaii, helped popularise surfing using a redwood board in the early years of the century.In the early 1950s, boards of balsa wood with a coat of fiberglass were introduced, and in the 1960s styrofoam and fiberglass boards became the standard.Hollywood films and rock-n-roll in the 1960s spread tidings of a carefree surfing lifestyle that hooked surfers and non-surfers everywhere, and pioneers in the subculture became legends.The names of Californians and Hawaiians who surfed or hand-crafted the best boards are now associated with prized collectibles: Bob Simmons, Phil Edwards, Mickey Dora, Greg Noll, Hobie Alter, Dale Velzy, John Peck, Lance Carson and Dewey Webber, to name a few.In addition to rarity and condition, some makers are more desirable than others.A board by Bob Simmons is a benchmark for any collection. He is credited with originating the idea of covering a balsa wood board with fiberglass in the late 1940s, and one in excellent condition should fetch $5,000 and up, according to Steve Pezman, editor of \"The Surfer's Journal.\"Collector Pete Noble turned down $25,000 for the Malibu Perpetual Surfboard, the centrepiece of one of the premier collections. For potential investment, he suggests avoiding restored surfboards on which dents, known as \"dings,\" and damage from the sun have been repaired.\"These are aesthetically beautiful but they've lost the originality that hard-core collectors treasure,\" he said.The prices of most production boards are more modest, between $300 and $1,000. Collectors stress that weathered, beat-up boards may not have appreciated very much, no matter who made or rode it.Collectors with many beautiful boards display them on loan at restuarants, museums, surf shops and professional offices.The hobby does not yet have a reliable, oft-updated price guide. Appraised value is pretty much agreed upon by a knowledgable buyer and seller, discussed through writing and by telephone. Auctions are rare, informal and advertised through the grapevine.There are different opinions, too, as to what is desirable.\"A brand's popularity may be localised depending on what beach you surfed at,\" Noble said. \"A board may be hot in Santa Cruz or another California community but surfers in Daytona (Fla.) or Cape Hatteras (N.C.) may not think much of it.\"Around 1967 a shorter style of styrofoam and fiberglass board about six- to seven-feet long became popular, but they are not as coveted as the older nine-to-10-foot \"longboards\" used until then. Yet collectors say these shouldn't be dismissed because demand may grow as the supply of longboards diminishes.Replicas of older boards are being made, primarily for display. Craftsmen Greg Noll -- a pioneer among big wave riders -- and Dale Velzy are turning out redwood longboards for $3,000 to $6,000, and Pat Curren is using imported balsa wood for longboards.\"If you can't get your hands on a vintage board for possible investment, I'd buy a Velzy or Noll wooden board. They're absolutely gorgeous for wall hanging and as a potential investment,\" said Lee Gerachis, owner of Malibu's Surf Shop in Ocean City, Maryland, and a long-time collector.One tip: Try not to overpay. If you're considering paying big money for a beautiful board, know what you are buying.If you have a cared-for board you want appraised or you want to buy one, surf shops and surfboard collectors clubs are helpful. Magazines such as \"Surfer's Journal,\" \"Surfer\" and \"Longboard\" run informative features.With the rise in value, counterfeiters are in the market.When buying a board, ask for original order forms and sales receipts. One good way to judge a board's authenticity is to know a craftsman's logo, which have evolved over the years and thus indicate age. \"It takes a trained eye to judge a board,\" said Gerachis.Said Pezman, \"A board's oral history should get passed along with it, but people are now trying to emulate other fields of collecting by placing a board's history in writing\" as documentation.Greg Escalante, a trustee member of the former Laguna Beach, Calif., Art Museum, sees surfboards as examples of functional sculpture. \"They have a glowing art spirit,\" he said.Prices will continue to rise, collectors say, as collectible boards attract a wider ownership and art historians recognise that surfboards express the soul of a golden moment in America.", "label": ["GCAT", "GENT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

All other decisions must be taken on the advice of  ministers.Hardie Boys said it would be for party leaders to conduct negotiations.\"If it gets to a stage where it looks as if we are getting to an impasse, I certainly have the right to talk to them and suggest they might sort out whatever differences there are outstanding and come to an accommodation rather than go back to the electorate as a last resort. \"I am sure no party would want to be seen as responsible for that.\"  \"Of course if he fails, and it is clear the majority against him is cohesive, then I would be entitled to call on the other group. By cohesive I don't mean that the coalition will clearly last a long time, but at least long enough to get past the first vote of no confidence. I certainly can't require a long term commitment for three years or anything of that kind.\"He acknowledged that coalitions could fall apart.\"That could well happen. I would want to be sure as far as I could that it would not dissolve in a week or two. That they really were agreed sufficiently to get on with government.\"But in the absence of anything but a shaky coalition?  Opinion polls consistently suggest the National Party will be the biggest in parliament, while short of a majority. A left-wing coalition is unlikely to command a majority, especially as the Alliance has ruled out post-election deals.In that situation, Prime Minister Jim Bolger would have the option of attempting to govern as a minority.\"If the PM decides he is going to see it out and test the position in parliament, then he is entitled to do that and see how he gets on,\" Hardie Boys said.  \"I do plan to be here (in Government House) in front of the television set to see what happens. I have tried to discourage the notion that everyone should get on the telephone and ring me up and say 'hey what about me?'\"Hardie Boys said it could well take a couple of weeks to \"sort everything out\", but did not think parliament should be called early to resolve the issue. \"No I think it is better they take time to sort it out.\" -- Wellington newsroom 64 4 473-4746  \"Yes, I would accept that, particularly if it survived a confidence vote.\"He said if no grouping could retain confidence in parliament, another election would probably have to be called and the incumbent would continue as a caretaker.Constitutional conventions indicate a caretaker government makes no major policy decisions and no major appointments, but Hardie Boys said: \"Even a caretaker government could stay in office until it loses a confidence vote.\"Given his pivotal role, what will he be doing on election night?", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Provident funds are long-term savings funds with special tax benefits.\"Nothing happens in the market. The high interest rate is killing the market and today's cut is not enough,\" said a trader at Lehava Investments.\"The session opened with mild gains following the lowering of the interest rate and activity remained low during most of the day.

When we see positive results (in inflation) interest rates will be adjusted further.\"Frenkel said the 0.5 percentage point cut in its key lending rate to commercial banks was justified because there is a reversal of inflation expectations and Israel is already seeing some benefits of the monetary restraint exercised by the central bank.But, he said: \"Inflation is still above the set target of the government and calls for a continuation of monetary restraint.\"Finance Minister Dan Meridor said at a meeting of the parliament's finance committee that \"without healthy capital markets it will be difficult for the economy to continue to grow and we will act to make the capital markets healthy.\"He said the central bank had a unique independence which needed to be preserved and its policies were based on those set by the government.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "M11", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

And he said it was possible to cut taxes and balance the budget, a claim the Clinton campaign has derided as unrealistic.While Dole hammered away at the policies of the Clinton administration, he was silent about the resignation of top Clinton strategist Dick Morris after a sensationalist supermarket tabloid reported that Morris had a long relationship with a high-priced call girl.Dole has been on vacation in southern California but has made some campaign appearances. California has 54 electoral votes, one fifth of the votes needed to win the presidency, and so far Clinton is leading in the state. Dole maintains he is not giving up on California.Dole also hammered away at liberal judges and illegal drugs, promising a \"real war on drugs\" if elected. He appeared with his running mate, former Representative Jack Kemp, who told the mostly white audience that Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War president who ended slavery, was the role model for both Dole and himself.Earlier in the week, Kemp campaigned for the black vote in south central Los Angeles, flashpoint of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. He told the Orange County audience about his visit and said a Dole presidency would \"deliver the hope of jobs.\"The Dole campaign on Friday also urged the Clinton campaign to sit down next week with Dole aides to work out details for upcoming presidential and vice presidential debates.\"This gives us plenty of lead time to start and of course it's going to take the Clinton campaign quite some time to do this. They have a bigger challenge then we do. They have to explain how Bill Clinton's been on two sides of so many issues,\" said Dole's press secretary Nelson Warfield.Dole told reporters as he was leaving his hotel in Irvine, California, that he still had not read Clinton's Thursday night acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention.\"Haven't read it yet.

{"token": "Financial services group Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV's (ING) interim results received a mixed response from analysts with some questioning the decision not to provide separate figures on Barings.ING earlier reported a 28 percent increase in half-year net profit to 1.51 billion guilders, midway through the range of forecasts between 1.46 billion and 1.56 billion.ING said it was no longer possible to report directly the effect on its results of Barings, the British merchant bank bought last year, as all of Barings' activities had now been integrated into the ING Barings business unit.  \"I'm keen to hear from ING about what happened to Barings. We would have expected Barings to have finally come through,\" said Ton Gietman of Van Meer James Capel.He said ING would have included a full six months' contribution from the British merchant bank, which collapsed after losses on fraudulent derivatives trading, compared with only three months in the first half of 1995.He also said ING's 11 percent growth in banking profits in the second quarter was disappointing when compared with the performance of other European banks, including its Dutch rival ABN AMRO.  Kempen and Co analyst Hans Pluijgers said he was disappointed ING had not given more indication of whether Barings was making a positive contribution to group profits.\"I think that's a bit odd,\" adding that it may be an indication that Barings was not performing as well as expected.He also wanted to know how much the acquisition contributed to the 157 percent surge in interim trading income, although he believed much of it came from ING's other operations.Pluijgers attributed the fall in ING's share price after the result to profit-taking as the shares had run up to about 55 guilders earlier this week from 45 guilders in mid-July.  Heinie Hakker of BZW Nederland found the share sell-off difficult to explain and believed the second quarter growth in profits to be very respectable.\"There's good progress on the life (insurance) side and banking is doing very well against a difficult comparison base,\" he said.Hakker also said ING's statement that it could not provide separate Barings figures was understable.But he added: \"Everybody is focussing on what Barings is doing.

{"token": "Natural Gas Corp said on Wednesday it expected its operational performance to improve over the 1996-97 year, but added that this would be influenced by increasingly competitive and therefore challenging trading conditions.  The company earlier reported a net profit for the year to June 30 of NZ$28.0 million, up from $22.2 million in the corresponding period last year.Chairman Len Bleasel said the directors were pleased with the company's earnings improvement, which reflected increased natural gas and by-product sales and further significant reductions in operating costs.He said the year was characterised by increasing gas trading competition and a continued focus by the company on the differing requirements of the contestable and non-contestable areas of its business.  Beasel said that generally, the company could look to the future with confidence.In particular, initiatives taken to add substantially to the company gas sales would reach fruition in 1996/97 with the commissioning of both the Southdown power plant in Auckland and a cogeneration plant at Edgecumbe. These would add more than eight petajoules to Natural Gas Corp sales over the year. In the year to June 30, earnings after tax were NZ$25.0 million compared with $22.2 million last year, before a positive after-tax revenue adjustment of $3.0 million.  The company said a significant post balance date event was the completion and distribution to the industry of a comprehensive Transmission Services Information Memorandum.This updated protocols published by the company in 1994 and formalised the process for non-discriminatory open access to Natural Gas Corp's high pressure pipeline system under posted tariffs, terms and conditions.As reported at the half year, the result included a non-recurring revenue gain of $4.5 million relating to previous period gas sales brought to income during the year under review. The after tax effect of this adjustment was a one-off earnings gain of $3.0 million.Excluding this adjustment, earnings of $25.0 million were 12.6 percent higher, and revenues from product sales, pipeline transportation services and specialist contract services rose by 2.7 percent to $248.8 million.Pre-adjustment earnings before interest and tax were 3.7 percent higher at $132.4 million.Natural Gas said the improved sales and cost reductions, combined with a three percent reduction to $51.2 million in debt servicing costs, more than offset increased taxation and lower returns from equity investments.  Operating cash flows increased by 6.9 percent to $107 million and a year-end cash balance of $8.0 million, compared with $25.2 million a year previously. Bleasel said this reflected the company's commitment to debt reduction.Total gas sales were 1.9 percent higher at 42.8 petajoules.Sales by the company's utilities, trading as NGC Gas Companies, rose by 3.5 percent to 18.3 petajoules, while sales by the company to other utilities returned to the 1994 level of 24.5 petajoules after a slight reduction to 24.3 petajoules in 1995.--Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746", "label": ["C152", "C15", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "India's new government has told visiting British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind that the nation's open-market economic programme is \"practically irreversible\", British officials said on Friday.Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, who heads a government which includes communists, and several of his ministers gave the assurance to Rifkind during the British foreign minister's two-day stay in the Indian capital which ends on Friday.\"The clear message from the prime minister and all the economic ministers was the reform process will continue,\" a British official said.Deve Gowda, who met Rifkind on Thursday, said the economic liberalisation programme was \"a practically irreversible process\", the official quoted the prime minister as saying.There were concerns among some foreign investors when Deve Gowda's 13-party centre-left coalition took power in June that it might roll back the free-market policies adopted by his predecessor, former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.But Rifkind told Indian businessmen over lunch that British industry was confident the new government would press ahead with the reforms, which have gradually let in foreign goods and investment.\"The fact that the new Indian government has pledged itself to continuity with regard to economic reform, further liberalisation, disinvestment and matters of that kind gives British industry the confidence to plan for the future and not just tomorrow or next week,\" he said.Rifkind reminded the businessmen that British Prime Minister John Major hoped to visit India in early 1997. \"I believe we can use that to give further boost\" to economic relations, Rifkind said, calling current ties extremely healthy.British officials said Rifkind urged his Indian counterparts to open up the state-controlled insurance sector to private investment, and to ease non-tariff barriers including restrictions on the entry of foreign lawyers.Among ministers with economic portfolios, Rifkind met Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and Commerce Minister Bolla Buli Ramaiah during his stay.Earlier this week Rifkind started his five-nation trip in Pakistan. He was due to fly to Colombo on Friday and later to Japan and Mongolia.Citing his country's experience, Rifkind said India would benefit from liberalised trade and the privatisation of state-owned industry.The removal of trade barriers can unsettle domestic industry, he said. \"But it's in India's interest to move in that direction. It far outweighs the temporary difficulties.\"Increased trade between India and Pakistan could ease tensions between the two long-time foes, Rifkind said. \"It would make it easier to solve the political problems,\" he said.Rifkind said the privatisation of British state-owned firms had led to unexpected benefits in the form of increased capital investment in the firms once they were in private hands leading to higher profits.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Farmers will be able to pursue high grain prices by withdrawing land from the Conservation Reserve on 60 days' notice, the Agriculture Department said in a long-expected rule Tuesday.The \"early out\" rule, mandated by the so-called Freedom to Farm law enacted in April, could have its first effects on the winter wheat crop, which is sown in the fall.About 36.4 million acres, mostly in the Great Plains and Midwest, have been enrolled in the Conservation Reserve since it was created in 1985. The program pays farmers an annual rent if they idle environmentally sensitive land for 10 years.  The \"early out\" rule was the latest in a series of announcements by the Agriculture Department to re-mold the Conservation Reserve in line with the 1996 farm policy law. It has yet to announce, however, the terms under which farmers would try to re-enroll land that was pulled from the reserve.A permanent rule, encompassing all the interim changes, was expected later this year, according to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.Under the \"early out\" rule, land could not be withdrawn unless it was in the reserve for at least five years and was not highly erodible or likely to jeopardize water quality.  Land ineligible for the \"early out\" included filter strips, grass waterways, riparian areas, windbreaks, shelterbelts, shallow water areas and wetlands.Not counting the exceptions, about 15 million acres would be eligible for early withdrawal, department analysts said.The Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri said the 36.4 million acres in the reserve included 10.8 million acres of former wheat land, 4.3 million that had a history of corn planting and four million formerly planted to soybeans.  Agriculture Department analysts said they had no estimate of how much land would be taken out of the Conservation Reserve under the \"early out\" option.Comparatively small amounts have been withdrawn under earlier initiatives by the department. On July 31, the department said 605,702 acres had been withdrawn under an \"early out\" offer made earlier in the year.Some analysts have said farmers might be reluctant, despite the two-year run of high grain prices, to give up the security of long-term Conservation Reserve rental payments.", "label": ["C13", "CCAT", "M141", "M14", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Riot police clashed with stone-throwing protesters in Paris after the arrest of 210 Africans in a church in the capital sparked anger at France's draconian immigration laws.Police fired teargas and set up powerful searchlights to keep several thousand protesters away from the Vincennes detention centre where most of the Africans were being held overnight on Saturday.France-Info public radio said about 20 people were hurt in the clashes in Vincennes, on the eastern edge of Paris. But an Interior Ministry spokesman reported no injuries and said protesters were dispersing around midnight (2200 GMT).The arrested Africans, rounded up in a raid by police who smashed their way in to the Saint-Bernard church in central Paris on Friday morning, included 10 on the 50th day of a hunger strike against earlier expulsion orders.The Vincennes protesters, shouting slogans to urge the release of the African detainees, had been part of a peaceful protest march of at least 6,000 people in Paris, including opposition politicians, film stars and human rights activists.\"Free the Sans Papiers (people without documents)\" they chanted.An opposition union said the government would expel a first group of the Africans by military plane from a base at Creil north of Paris at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Saturday.The Defence Ministry declined comment on the report, by the pro-Socialist CFDT union. Most of the Africans are from Mali, Senegal and Zaire.The centre-right government, backed by a court opinion that none of the Africans in the church had an automatic right to stay in France, has said about 30 or 40 percent of the protesters would qualify for residence permits.Other cases were under review and the rest would be expelled. France-Info said mothers with children rounded up in the Saint-Bernard church had been released quietly on Friday afternoon.About 300 Africans, from babies to grandmothers, had been sleeping in dismal conditions on the floor of the Saint-Bernard church since July. Police reckon 50 of the Africans slipped away before Friday's swoop by a force of 1,500 police.French President Jacques Chirac, who has not commented publicly on the Africans, was due to meet Prime Minister Alain Juppe at the president's summer retreat on the Riviera on Saturday for a weekend of talks, mainly about economic strategy.Opposition parties accused Juppe of cynically courting the anti-immigrant National Front, with an eye on 1998 general elections, and of jeopardising France's reputation as a cradle of human rights by imposing controversial 1993 immigration laws.\"The laws have been badly handled and are not efficient against illegal workers,\" Socialist leader Lionel Jospin said. \"The style of this government is to smash things.\"The 1993 laws have left many immigrants in a legal limbo, outlawing some who were previously living in France legally.The government defended the raid on the church, saying it had to crack down to discourage future illegal immigration.\"Many people are watching what's happening in France in Bamako, Libreville or Kinshasa...France doesn't have a limitless capacity to take everyone,\" Integration Minister Eric Raoult said.Cooperation Minister Jacques Godfrain said he would travel to Mali in September with a development package to encourage Malians to stay at home, for instance by bolstering local agriculture such as cotton farming.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GREL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

We have lost precious six months and now face a real problem of how to restructure our debts,\" Miroljub Labus, a chief economist of the Economic Institute, told reporters.He indicated, however, that the government's hopes pinned on the decree may be too far-fetched.\"The government's idea is to get the first so-called golden tranche from the IMF to the extent of $120 million -- the amount rump Yugoslavia owes the Fund -- (which) is unrealistic,\" Labus said.\"First we must reactivate our IMF membership, repay what we owe and then prepare an economic programme and submit it to the Fund,\" he said.The IMF would condition any further help on the real value of the dinar, the central bank discount rate as well as lower public spending, he added.The decree, so far not made public even in the Official Gazzette, does not contain a word on the legal continuity of rump Yugoslavia, according to a senior government official, who asked not to be named.The continuity issue -- Belgrade wants to be seen as the legal successor to old Yugoslavia -- was at the heart of a dispute with the IMF.Although the Yugoslav government has not released the decree, it issued a statement saying the decree \"means Yugoslavia has ratified the IMF document and that its membership with the Fund is recognised without any interruption since 1945.\"The government official told Reuters that the decree was a step forward but further negotiations were still needed.\"Even though the legal document marks progress, it is still too early to say Yugoslavia's IMF membership will be resolved immediately after the Fund is notified of Yugoslavia's decision.Some economists predicted Yugoslavia would normalise its relations with the IMF and other creditors after September elections in Bosnia when U.N. sanctions, suspended last November, are expected to be permanently lifted.", "label": ["E12", "E212", "E21", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Botha, in the 1980s \"created circumstances and an atmosphere which were conducive to many of the abuses and transgressions against human rights which form the basis of the Commission's present investigations.\"He said most of the officials, police and soldiers who defended white rule were honorable men and women who believed they were protecting their country against communism.But he said none of the abuses that have been reported to Tutu's commission since it began work in April were officially sanctioned by his government.\"In dealing with the unconventional strategies from the side of the government, I want to make it clear from the outset that, within my knowledge and experience, they never included the authorisation of assassination, murder, torture, rape, assault or the like.\"Nor did I individually, directly or indirectly, ever suggest, order or authorise any such action,\" he said.De Klerk said that after the National Party began to move away from strict apartheid, it was criticised from within white Afrikaner ranks for being too \"soft\".\"I suspect that many of the unauthorised actions that are now coming to light were at the time directed as much against the transformation process as they were directed against the revolutionary threat.\"It has now become clear that certain elements misused state funds and were involved in unauthorised operations leading to abuses and violations of human rights,\" he said.One former policeman who headed a secretive government unit fighting black political groups recently admitted to more than 100 charges including murder and assault.De Klerk said he accepted overall responsibility for government actions under his leadership, but said ministers and military leaders should accept the blame for things they ordered or allowed their juniors to believe they had ordered.Ending with a call for reconciliation, he said: \"We must accept the importance of reconciliation, of coming to terms with ourselves, our neighbours and our past -- of forgiving and of being forgiven.\"", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

If it turns as many computer models predict, it could leave the U.S. coast untouched.At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), Edouard was 865 miles (1,400 km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, at latitude 24.3 north and longitude 68.6 west. It was moving west-northwest at 14 mph (22 kph).In coastal areas of North Carolina, battered by Hurricane Bertha in mid-July, residents and business owners took a wait-and-see attitude. Motel owners in Hatteras Village said they had had few cancellations as people seemed to be staying with their Labour Day weekend plans, at least for the moment.\"I think people are waiting to see what it's going to do,\" said Katie Oden, owner of the Sea Gull motel. \"It might hurt us even if it does turn but you got to take it as it comes.\"Hurricane watches -- alerting residents to storm conditions within 36 hours -- were issued for the northeastern Caribbean islands of Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, St. Eustatius and Saba as Fran approached the Leeward Islands.At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), it was located 300 miles (490 km) east of Antigua, at latitude 17.9 north and longitude 57.2 west, and moving west-northwest at 15 mph (24 kmh).

{"token": "Mixed economic data and a touch of political pressure might be the recipe for steady monetary policy through the U.S. presidential election on November 5 pundits and former Federal Reserve officials said.Members of the Federal Open Market Committee are expected to be careful as they juggle upcoming key data, such as the August employment report on September 6, and the vicissitudes of the political race for the White House.\"Every member of that FOMC is going to be very careful,\" said Preston Martin, a former Fed vice chairman.  \"That means that the odds build up about no action. No action is safer than some action,\" added Martin, currently the chairman of HomeVest Financial Services Inc in San Francisco.The Fed opted to hold short-term rates steady on Tuesday during the year's fifth meeting of its policy-setting arm. The central bank's target for the federal funds rate remains at 5.25 percent. The discount rate is unchanged at 5.0 percent.Analysts said the latest string of economic indicators painted a blurry economic outlook. Without clear signs that inflation is heating up, they said, the Federal Reserve will probably stand pat until the picture clears.  \"I think they will stand still and await clarification on where the economy is going,\" said Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor and currently an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.How long could that take? \"Well, I think the Fed will move sometime later this year... It may well be until very late this year, possibly even December, before the Fed knows for sure whether it needs to move or not,\" Gramley added.But Gramley believes the U.S. economy is fundamentally strong and \"some tightening will be necessary down the road.\"  Martin agreed that the Fed is likely to remain on hold, \"not just because of the election, but because this (current economic scene) is a central banker nirvana.\"Martin cited a positive inflation outlook as one of the main reasons keeping the Fed on hold over the next few months.Recent economic indicators suggested consumer spending and the labor market are heating up in August. Meanwhile, signs of a slowing manufacturing sector with scant evidence of incipient inflation are seen as offsetting growth signals.  \"Before the Fed can either raise or cut interest rates in an election year, they better have a solid economic justification for doing that,\" said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp.\"Without the justifications, they would rather wait,\" he added.Pundits said current legislative efforts to alter the Fed's official mandate will also encourage FOMC members to be careful before making a decision to change monetary policy.  Earlier this month, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, an adviser to Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole, has urged changing the law that gives the Fed a dual mandate to fight inflation and promote maximum employment.Bennett and Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla are co-sponsoring a bill that would make fighting inflation the U.S. central bank's only mandate.\"There is pending legislation to change the objectives of the Fed and there has been informal discussion about changing the role that Federal Reserve Bank presidents play, since they are not confirmed by the Senate,\" Martin said.  \"So the FOMC members will be careful about the appearance of overzealousness or on the other hand disregard of ... inflation,\" Martin said.In the event of an interest rate hike, analysts said the Clinton campaign would have more to lose than Republican challenger Bob Dole.But then again, it would be hard for the Clinton administration to criticize any possible Fed action just a few months after the president nonimated Alan Greenspan as the Fed chairman for a fresh four-year mandate.\"If Mr. Greenspan were to raise rates, I think Mr. Clinton would get hurt ... That would put the Administration in an awkward position,\" Sohn's said.Thus, analysts said the relationship among the White House, the Treasury and the Fed has usually been very amicable, ranging from weekly breakfasts to tennis matches.\"The Fed would never surprise the Treasury. There is frequent contact between Fed and White House and Treasury officials,\" Martin said. \"I used to play tennis with those guys. The Fed has a tennis court, amazingly enough.\"However, the mere fact a presidential race was underway has not prevent the Fed from shifting monetary policy in the past.

{"token": "Prosecutors arrested Japan's top expert on haemophilia and AIDS on Thursday in a widening scandal on charges stemming from accusations he knowingly administered tainted blood products to hundreds of patients.The Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office arrested Takeshi Abe, 80, on professional negiligence charges, a police spokesman said.The move follows legal complaints filed against Abe by the family of a haemophiliac who received unheated blood products from Abe's hospital team. The patient died of AIDS in 1991.Abe is under suspicion of using blood products which had not been heat-treated on haemophiliac patients, knowing that the products could have been tainted with the HIV virus.Prosecutors also raided Abe's home, the offices of the Health Ministry and Teikyo University in Tokyo, where he was a professor and vice president, on Thursday.\"The investigation of involved parties including the Health Ministry will be a difficult but necessary ordeal for us to rebuild public trust,\" said Health Minister Naoto Kan.Abe, a specialist in haemophilia, headed a research team set up by the Health Ministry in 1983 to investigate the source of AIDS infection in Japan.He is believed to have influenced the team's decision in March 1984 to favour the use of unheated blood products instead of using safer heated products, such as cryoprecipitate.The Health Ministry did not ban the unheated products until December 1985.Last month, Abe testified in parliament that he had no choice but to use untreated blood products in the 1980s because cryoprecipitate was not easily available, and even if used tended to dangerously clog blood vessels.But media reports quoted specialists as saying it was possible to obtain cryoprecipitate at the time and that they had not experienced it clogging blood vessels as Abe said.Japanese media reports said Abe secretly asked U.S. researchers in 1984 to test blood samples from his haemophiliac patients in which over half tested HIV-positive. He did not tell the patients or publish the results.More than 2,000 haemophiliacs in Japan have become infected with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus which causes AIDS, from tainted blood products.Thursday's arrest and raid was the second police action in the widening scandal.Prosecutors in Osaka, western Japan, last week raided the offices of drug maker Green Cross Corp on suspicion the firm knowingly sold HIV-tainted blood products, and questioned former company president Renzo Matsushita.The Health Ministry for years maintained it could not find documents on the case, but in February officials revealed files from the 1983 study group chaired by Abe indicating that ministry authorities were aware of the danger of HIV infection from unheated products.In March, Japanese haemophiliacs accepted an out-of-court settlement of a one-time payment of 45 million yen ($424,000) each, ending a seven-year legal battle against the state and five pharmaceutical firms, including Green Cross.\"I'm glad that the issue is finally being treated as a criminal case,\" said Ryohei Kawada, one of the plaintiffs and himself a haemophiliac who came down with the deadly virus from untreated blood products.\"Abe didn't do all this by himself. I hope future investigations will expose the responsibility of the Health Ministry and other bureaucrats,\" Kawada told reporters.Latest ministry figures show there are 1,154 people with AIDS and another 2,942 with the HIV virus in Japan, a nation of 123 million.About 400 haemophiliacs have already died from AIDS and AIDS-related complications, activists say.

She hit a backhand crosscourt winner to save one game point, got to deuce and then unleashed a forehand crosscourt winner to break serve.After holding serve at 30, Graf won the first three points off Zvereva's serve in the 10th game for triple set point and claimed the set two points later on a double fault.\"She can play great games and then have lapses in between,\" Graf said. \"So you know you're going to get your chances.\"Now in full stride, Graf won the first four games of the second set on her way to a 58-minute victory and a berth in the fourth round, where she was joined by two other fast finishers.Martina Hingis of Switzerland, the 16th seed, matched Graf minute-for-minute in beating Japan's Naoko Kijimuta 6-2 6-2, while Austrian Judith Wiesner needed only 49 minutes to beat Czech Petra Langrova.Graf faces the winner of the night match between 14th seed Barbara Paulus and 15-year-old Russian Anna Kournikova, with Hingis likely to meet third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, who plays Russian Elena Likhovtseva on the grandstand.Wiesner, who upset fifth seed Iva Majoli in the opening round, has her fourth-round opponent -- Rita Grande of Italy, a 7-5 6-1 winner over Els Callens of Belgium.On the men's side, 13th seed Thomas Enqvist of Sweden became the first player into the fourth round by storming past Pablo Campana of Ecuador 6-4 6-4 6-2.", "label": ["GCAT", "GSPO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The Washington Post reported on Wednesday, quoting unnamed sources, that the department was at least 11 days away from giving ValuJet its reguatory go-ahead.Wednesday was the second and final day for FAA inspectors to put a ValuJet DC-9 through a series of flight exercises to determine whether the plane and its crew were up to standard.ValuJet closed its doors in the aftermath of the May 11 Florida Everglades crash that killed all 110 aboard. Publicity surrounding the disaster helped to encourage the FAA to step up safety inspections at the airline.On June 18, ValuJet executives signed an FAA order that closed the company amid a swarm of alleged safety violations. The company now must wait to see if it meets the standards laid down by the document.\"We're sitting at a red light waiting for it to turn green,\" said Kenyon.Last month the union that represents ValuJet's flight attendants petitioned the Transportation Department to remove the airline's top officers, saying they were unwilling or unable to operate a safe airline.Asked if the recertification had been held up because of the petition, department spokesman William Schulz said: \"We can't comment on details of the review, which is underway.\"As recently as Tuesday morning, ValuJet said it was hopeful of receiving permission to advertise and sell tickets and approval to resume flight operations for Friday.Kenyon said airline executives realised by 3 p.m. on Tuesday that they would not be able to meet their self-imposed deadline, but he declined to comment further.ValuJet has recalled 70 pilots and about 100 flight attendants for training in preparation for a resumption of service.

{"token": "North Dakota's spring wheat crop was about one-third harvested and early yields were running above average expectations, a spokesman for the state's wheat commission told Reuters on Friday.\"We're probably around that 30 to 33 percent mark being harvested,\" said Jim Peterson, marketing specialist for the North Dakota Wheat Commission.Peterson said yields in southeast North Dakota, South Dakota and central and southern Minnesota had been \"certainly above expectations.\" He said he had heard reports of many fields yielding more than 50 bushels per acre.  But Peterson warned that yields of 50 bushels would likely be the exception, not the norm, when tabulating North Dakota's final average spring wheat yield.\"The key thing is that the best wheat has now been harvested,\" Peterson said.Peterson said the average yield to date was probably 15 bushels per acre higher than the average for fields in western North Dakota, where wheat was planted late and has since been stressed by heat and dryness.Still, Peterson said test weights had so far been \"exceptional,\" running 62 to 64 pounds per bushel on average.  Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture pegged North Dakota's 1996 spring wheat yield at 30.0 bushels per acre, which would be a three bushel increase over the state's actual 1995 yield of 27.0 bushels.Managers at scattered North Dakota elevators confirmed that the harvest had yet to progress further to the north, and said the average yield in the northern part of the state would probably be lower than in the south.Keith Ihry, manager of the Farmers Elevator Co in Walhalla, in northeast North Dakota, said that only about 10 percent of the wheat in his region had been harvested.  \"The wheat we've taken in so far has been of pretty good quality, with yields in the 30 to 40 bushels per acre range,\" Ihry said.Ihry said he had not seen much of a problem with scab, a fungal disease that can cause yield and quality losses on all small grain crops, but he said \"it could get worse in some of the later-planted stuff\".Dennis Novacek, manager of the Fessenden Co-op Association, a grain elevator in central North Dakota, said wheat harvest was around 15 percent complete in his area.\"The early stuff looks pretty good but we're just starting to get into some of the scabbier stuff,\" Novacek said.He said yields were running between 20 to 40 bushels per acre, but that there were \"more 40-bushel fields than 20.\"--Greg Frost, 816 561-8671", "label": ["C21", "CCAT", "M141", "M14", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders.The so-called order handling rules, which were proposed last September, were approved in a 4-0 vote.The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them.The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time.Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock. In a limit order, investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell, as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices.\"These rules are intended to empower all investors, by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field, and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions,\" said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt.The SEC's goal, he added, was to create \"one system where one price could be available to everybody.\"The director of the SEC's division of market regulation, Richard Lindsey, said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about $7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules.In proposing the rules last year, the SEC noted that while technology has improved, commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors' best interests.It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market.It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems, thus robbing investors without access to \"hidden\" quotes the benefit of the best available prices.Earlier this month, the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market, the National Association of Securities Dealers, agreed to spend $100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers' trading practices.The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed.The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the \"price improvement\" proposal again.The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous \"bid\" and \"ask\" quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq.The SEC's limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq, where such orders have never been displayed. The president of the Nasdaq, Alfred Berkeley, was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules' effects on the market, the second largest in the world.", "label": ["C13", "CCAT", "M11", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Hospitals in Cyprus were on stand-by and there was tight police security at Larnaca airport.Cairo airport sources said earlier the plane was hijacked about 20 minutes after it took off from Khartoum airport.It was the second hijacking this year involving a Sudanese airliner.On March 24, a Sudan Airways Airbus A320 plane carrying 40 passengers and crew was hijacked to Eritrea.The two Sudanese hijackers who seized the plane on an internal flight sought political asylum in Eritrea.

{"token": "When employees of southwestern Alaska's Togiak National Wildlife Refuge saw about 225 walruses waddle up a hill next to their normal beach, they rushed to protect the bulky animals.Cape Peirce staffers herded 155 of them back from the edge of a 200-foot cliff, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials said on Friday.But 70 remained near the precipice, and by the end of the day, most had toppled over. Up to 60 died, and others were seriously injured.Three days later, federal biologists still do not know why.\"The only theory we're kicking around right now is the beach has changed,\" refuge manager Aaron Archibeque said.He cited a large sand dune that had been eroded by wind. Its absence allowed the walruses, which can weigh up to two tons each, to wander farther back from the beach than before, he said.Ruled out are any notions of emotional distress. \"It's not a suicide. They're not doing it on purpose,\" Archibeque said.Walrus death plunges have occurred twice before at the same location. Seventeen fatalities were recorded in October 1995 and 42 in September 1994, officials said.But biologists believe those incidents were connected to fierce winds and stormy weather. This week's carnage occurred during warm, clear, calm weather, Archibeque said.Nothing similar has been known to take place anywhere else, he said.Cape Peirce is the biggest walrus haulout, or resting place, on mainland North America, accommodating up to 12,500 animals at a time.The day after the accident, about 500 walruses were on the beach, Archibeque said.All were males, as were all those that fell off the cliff. Bulls and cows mingle only during mating season in January and February, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.This week's deaths are not considered to pose a biological threat to the walrus population, Archibeque said.He said the carcasses would be allowed to wash out to sea after the tusks had been cut off and given to local Yupik Eskimos, who hunt the animals for meat and ivory.", "label": ["GCAT", "GENV"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Robert Bode, head of research at Hendry Hay McIntosh, said that brokerage's forecast of NZ$15.6 million had not changed.The market would be eager for news on the costs side after the company, in its June update, signalled there had been over-runs in the first 90 days of operation.Analysis of seasonal trends would been keenly noted.The market also expects to see trends in visitation and revenue per machine and per table. Signs of a pickup in ancilliary services would also be noted.ANZ Securities' Raymond Webb said he was expecting NZ$15.2-15.5 million.  \"I would expect that the return from gaming would have continued the strong trend of outperformance that we saw in the initial 90-day period, partially offset by lower than budgeted returns from the hotel and other activities,\" Webb said.Seasonal aspects remained a big unknown, but Webb said the Australian experience suggested the longer the period of operation, the win to the casino per patron tended to improve as larger gamblers returned and sightseer visits faded away.  Sky City may also choose the occasion to detail its expansion plans via casino applications for Wellington and possibly Queenstown in the South Island. Overseas opportunities or other areas of the leisure industry could not be ruled out.\"The company has been emphatic that it's not going to be a one-operation business, so I would expect that, over time, they would diversify into other gaming facilities and possibly other oportunities in the broader leisure sector,\" Webb said.Table gaming business for the first 90 days was well above initial projections with an average win to the casino per table per day of NZ$3,220.  Slot win also showed positive growth with an average win per slot per day of $179. Daily slot revenue had shown steady growth since opening and has continued to improve.Sky City is half-owned by Brierley Investments Ltd. Harrah's Entertainment, which manages the casino, owns 12.5 percent.Sky City's listing documents forecast a NZ$35.8 million profit in the year to June 1997 -- its first full year of trading -- and $40.8 million in 1998.-- Wellington newsroom (64 4 4734746)", "label": ["C152", "C15", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Adelaide broker Day Cutten said reduced grape prices in 1997 and 1998 will lower costs and boost sales volumes for Australian wine companies but margins may be tempered by some price pressures and a rising dollar.Writing in the broker's 1996 Wine Companies Review, analyst Roly Michelmore said discounting of semi-premium white wines was likely in the next 18 months, following the bumper 1996 vintage, which would put pressure on margins in those categories.  Michelmore said the most positive aspect of the vintage is the capacity it will give exporters to market increased volumes at reasonable cost, with 1996/97 (June 30) revenue growth to be mainly volume growth, also in domestic but especially in export markets.Surveying six local wine companies, Day Cutten recommended accumulating stock in bulk producer Australian Vintage Ltd and holding for Australia's third largest producer BRL Hardy Ltd (buying at A$2.20), Peter Lehmann Wines Ltd, and bulk producer Simeon Wines Ltd.  Michelmore said Australian Vintage (Thursday close A$2.05) provided an opportunistic exposure to the medium term rapid growth of the industry through its core bulk processing business.Earnings diversity and long term growth would arise as vineyard development matured and bottled wine sales expanded.For BRL Hardy (close A$2.85) Michelmore said price rises throughout the product range indicated improving brand images and skilful marketing, while forecast earnings per share (EPS) growth of nine percent to 16.5 cents from 15.2 cents was sound.  Estimating a A$19.6 million net profit for the 1996 calendar year and A$22 million in 1997, up from 1995's A$17.3 million, he said the expected boost to earnings in 1997 and beyond would be sourced in the company's extensive premium vinyeard investment.For Peter Lehmann Wines (close A$0.95), good performance from both branded and bulk wine operations were expected to result in EPS growth of 16 percent to 6.02 cents for 1995/96, while Simeon Wines (close A$2.36) was forecast to produce a 15 percent rise in net earnings above prospectus in 1995/96 to A$3.44 million.  Day Cutten advised selling shares in Normans Wines Ltd (close $0.80), saying poor performance and excessive costs in the company's agency business were largely responsible for an estimated 87 percent slump in EPS to 1.9 cents in 1995/96.Michelmore forecast Normans would produce only a A$320,000 net profit in 1995/96, rising to A$1.74 million in 1996/97, down from its maiden A$2.08 million profit in 1994/95.  He also recommended lightening in Petaluma Wines Ltd (close A$7.24), saying the current market premium in the stock was excessive, despite the quality of assets and management.\"We expect further expansion through acquisition or merger in the relatively near term,\" he said.Michelmore said acqusition of established brands was seen by many in the industry as the quickest and cheapest means to access export growth, which appeared to be limited by Australia's ability to supply rather than level of demand.  The most imminent industry move was the likelihood that Foster's Brewing Group Ltd would seek to significantly expand its wine business, with BRL Hardy and Southcorp Holdings Ltd's wine division suitable choices, he said.Michelmore said the greatest challenge for the industry would be to attract and service the estimated A$5 billion required to develop vineyard and processing capacity to produce 6.5 percent of the projected world wine output, up from two percent, as detailed under the industry's 30 year strategy.-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800", "label": ["C15", "C152", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The explosion of Western Europe's first Ariane-5 rocket on its maiden flight in June caused little environmental damage, space officials in French Guiana said on Tuesday.\"Flight 501 was very bad from a technological point of view -- a failure in flight,\" Michel Mignot, head of the French Space Agency's (CNES) Guiana Space Centre, told a news conference.\"It demonstrated the capacity of the space centre to predict the extremely limited impact on the environment and the lack of risk for the local population,\" he added.Reporters who flew over the mangrove swamp in a helicopter, where pieces of the rocket fell in burning fragments, saw that most of the destroyed vegetation had grown back in less than three months.But several patches of trees stripped of their foliage were still visible, the largest the size of a truck.CNES environmental officer Jean-Marc Andre said 37 toxic gas detectors were activated during the failed flight and revealed insignificant levels of hydrochloric acid in the atmosphere following the explosion.\"Our instruments detected maximum hydrochloric acid levels at 0.05 parts per million (ppm). Legislation permits exposure at 5 ppm for 15 minutes and only exposure exceeding 50 ppm is considered to be a health hazard,\" Andre said.Environmentalists had warned that hydrochloric acid and alumina would damage flora and fauna in the Amazonian equatorial rain forest surrounding the space centre in Kourou, on the northeast coast of South America, and had called for the debut launch to be postponed.They said the risk came from the rocket's two solid fuel strap-on boosters that each burn 237 tonnes of fuel during the rocket's first 130 seconds of flight.The explosion was a major setback for Western Europe's effort to maintain its position as leader in launching commercial satellites, and to eventually launch a manned mission aboard Ariane-5 for Europe's participation in the international space station Alpha.The European Space Agency (ESA) has invested over eight billion dollars in the Ariane-5 programme over the last 10 years. France is the largest participant investing 46.2 percent of the total.The second Ariane-5 launch had been planned for next month but will now be delayed until March 1997 at the earliest.An inquiry board investigating the explosion concluded in late July that the failure was caused by software design errors in the rocket's inertial reference system.", "label": ["CCAT", "GCAT", "GENV"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August, reports said Friday, sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day.The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $317.6 billion -- nearly twice the increase that had been expected.Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose, as did order backlogs, in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months.A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing. While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses, the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check.Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring, and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policy-makers had wanted.\"It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point,\" said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla.The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed, the nation's central bank, would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation, driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running.The 30-year Treasury fell almost a point, raising its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late on Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 41 points to 5,606, after a 64.73-point decline on Thursday.A third report from the Commerce Department, on July personal income and spending, pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half.It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June. Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June.July's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months, since January when they were flat.Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending, which fuels two-thirds of the nation's economy, may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half, which should slow economic growth.\"The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth,\" Naroff said in a written comment.The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept. 24 to plot interest-rate strategy. It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1/2-year-old economic expansion.In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday, Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were \"mixed signals\" about the economy's direction.\"I think that, on balance, it is looking a little bit on the strong side,\" Lindsey said. He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low \"the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating.\"While July consumer spending rose only slightly, there were ample indications that consumers remained confident.The University of Michigan's August index of consumer sentiment, made available on Friday to paying subscribers, rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July.Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production.\"The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent (annual) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range,\" she said, above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary.New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products.Orders for durable goods, meant to last three years or more, rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June. Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June.", "label": ["E131", "E13", "E311", "E31", "E71", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite is still languishing after its July rout, diverging from the rebound in NYSE listed stocks that have catapulted the Dow industrials to within arm's reach of record territory.\"There is still a big divergence between what has happened on the NYSE and Nasdaq. Nasdaq, mainly because of technology, has really languished. The advance/decline is pretty horrible compared with the NYSE,\" said Frank Gretz, a technical analyst at Shields & Co.Analysts said the divergence weighed on the overall market.  Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane, said the divergence \"was a good enough reason to see the market correct.\"The Dow was off 38 points to 5684 in quiet Wednesday early afternoon trading. The Nasdaq Composite lost two to 1122.On July 5, Wall Street was sent into a tailspin after a shockingly strong June payrolls report. Further stock selling was fueled by dismal earnings and warnings from such notable companies as Motorola and Hewlett-Packard. In total, the Dow slumped 10 percent or some 500 points before regaining its footing but Nasdaq endured a 20 percent bear market.  Since July 5, the Dow has risen nearly two percent and is nearing its May 22 record closing high of 5778.00. But the Nasdaq Composite is still off about three percent despite its recent rebound.\"Secondary and technology stocks are still not doing well. Nasdaq has languished for three weeks and has had a rally in a bear market so far,\" Gretz said.Market analysts said the Dow's recovery has been aided by a flight to quality with investors mindful of the July blowup of more speculative issues.

In many instances, officers used their hands and even their fists to get people out of their path.After only a few minutes of hand-to-hand grappling with the throngs of supporters, they reached the church gate.One policeman used a heavy axe to smash the chain holding a gate shut, and then the church's heavy wooden main gate was torn down in turn.But the Africans, huddled inside the church, had stacked chairs and other furniture in front of the doors -- obstacles patiently removed one by one by the police.Among the first to be led from the church through the howling crowd were French film beauty Emmanuelle Beart and political activist and cancer specialist Leon Schwartzenberg.The two were among numerous personalities who had flocked to the church in recent days to show their support for the protesters.Then came the hunger strikers, carried out on stretchers to waiting ambulances.Later, the rest of the Africans were escorted out, some willingly, others resisting all the way.\"They took me by the arms and dragged me into a bus. Then they brought out my daughter,\" said Madjiguene Cisse, who had acted as a spokeswoman for the Africans during the protest's final days.\"There, we're leaving,\" she told Reuters by mobile phone as the buses began pulling away from the church.Another spokesman for the protesters, Aboubakar Diop, was carried out of the church by plainclothes officers as if he were a sack of potatoes.

Both men were in 1979 sentenced to death in absentia for overseeing the death of more than one million people.Tea Banh said there had been clashes between the rival Khmer Rouge groups near Phnom Malai, a forest-clad mountain area on the border with Thailand, but the government had not intervened as the dissidents felt strong enough to beat off any threat.Khmer Rouge radio, which remains loyal to hardliners led by Pol Pot, claimed on Tuesday that \"the traitors in Malai\" had asked the government's 12th Division to help put down dissent from Khmer Rouge rank and file in the area.\"The traitors have a lot of money and they can leave the bases easily but the people cannot leave, so the people are furious with them and have started planning to kill the traitors,\" it reported.The Ieng Sary commanders, in a statement read out on state radio on Tuesday, denied Khmer Rouge claims there had been demonstrations in their bases. They said Pol Pot had publicly said violence should be avoided while sending small groups to fight the dissidents.State radio said people had decided to cut off all radio and phone contacts with hardliners and called on all Khmer Rouge fighters to avoid fighting each other.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

He's passed a lie detector test.

They were impressively strong figures, but we think the Bundesbank will not be swayed by them.\"Gernot Nerb, IFO's former chief economist who now works for Salomon Brothers, was among those who urged the Bundesbank to go ahead and cut the repo, adding that business investment still remained weak and the IFO index level still fairly low.\"The recovery in the index will not change the decision if they are decided to cut,\" he told Reuters Financial Television. \"The Bundesbank should not be worried by the jump and I would recommend a cut (in the repo) by 10-15 basis points.\"Tension in currency markets since the Bundesbank decided to leave policy on hold ahead four weeks ago ahead of its summer break has intensified market interest in tomorrow's decision.On Tuesday, analysts had become convinced that the central bank would now judge conditions right to make a long-promised cut in the repo, dangled as a carrot to markets when the official discount and Lombard rates were eased by 1/2 percentage point each in April.A slowdown in July German money supply growth -- the Bundesbank's main monetary policy indicator -- to an annualized rate of 8.6 percent from 9.6 percent in June was judged enough to tip the balance in favour of a move.Although the figure remained well beyond a 7 percent target ceiling, analysts said that the goal was now in reach and said this could be enough to convince the Bundesbank it could afford to relax policy a little.But even with the economic necessity for a rate cut thrown into question by the Ifo and orders data, some analysts persisted in the view that action was likely this week.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "President Boris Yeltsin has backed the actions of his envoy to Chechnya Alexander Lebed after a puzzling delay, but appears to have tied the hands of the gruff general by insisting the territory remains part of Russia.The president's support, reversing strong reservations expressed on Thursday, should help untangle the twisted chain of command on who is responsible for what in the Caucasus region.But Yeltsin insisted after a late-night phone call with Lebed on Friday that Lebed must not let Chechnya leave the vast Russian Federation -- a key demand from the separatists throughout their 20-month-old struggle with Russian troops.Press spokesman Sergei Yastrzhmebsky said on Saturday that Yeltsin and Lebed had held \"positive, detailed and constructive talks\".\"The president authorised Lebed to continue discussions and sign an agreement on the political regulation of the Chechen conflict defining the political status of the Chechen republic as an integral part of the Russian Federation,\" he said in a statement released by Yeltsin's office.Yeltsin appointed Lebed to represent him in Chechnya earlier this month and the retired general swept into action with a string of visits to talk to rebel military leaders.Last Thursday, the two sides agreed a ceasefire -- the latest in a series -- which both sides say has been holding to a large extent.But on the same day the president, in his first televised appearance since he was inaugurated for a second term in office on August 9, said he was not entirely satisfied with Lebed's performance in Chechnya, complaining he was taking too long to resolve the crisis.\"These words cause bewilderment,\" Nezavisimaya Gazeta said on Saturday. \"Any tactless remark, especially expressed by the state's top official, could have a psychologically unfavourable impact and can affect both the mood of the negotiators and the military, who have been deeply depressed for many months.\"Yastrzhembsky, appointed on August 12, said the interview was recorded on Thursday morning, before details emerged of the agreement Lebed was signing with the separatists.But the Kremlin statement did not explain why Yeltsin waited more than 24 hours before approving Lebed's actions, a delay which revived speculation that nobody was in charge of Russian policy in the breakaway region.Both Defence Ministry and Interior Ministry troops operate in the region, but cooperation between the two sides leaves much to be desired.Lebed, who has asked Yeltsin to sack Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov for bungling the conflict, has no clear power base in Moscow. He said on Friday he was in command of the situation in Grozny, but the claim looked hollow without clear backing from the president.To make matters worse, Yeltsin, exhausted after the reelection campaign, disappeared for two days this week.Aides said he had travelled to northwestern Russia to decide whether to take a longer holiday there.

Residents said the stoppage was widely observed but a Reuters photographer in Hebron said most shops in the city, still under Israeli guns, remained open.In a move likely to fuel further Palestinian anger, Israel on Thursday disclosed more plans to build additional homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank.\"(Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai) approved a number of construction plans in existing settlements.

It is playing with a powder keg that puts all of us in danger.\"Palestinian Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi told reporters Palestinians were not interested in Israeli \"promises in the air\".\"The real proof (of Israel's intentions) is in this decision to build thousands more housing units, to confiscate more land, to expand settlements and settlement activities,\" she said.In Ramallah in the West Bank, Arafat held talks with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti.\"We informed the president that we do not accept any analysis that calls for continuing settlement expansion and at the same time to say the peace process is all right,\" Kabariti told reporters.", "label": ["E41", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GJOB", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "For the 20 months since President Boris Yeltsin sent troops to crush Chechnya's bid to secede from Russia, the question of who is in charge of the crisis has been unclear.Confusion over Moscow's biggest military operation since the Afghan war was illustrated again on Wednesday.Just hours before a deadline set by the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya for an all-out bombardment of its capital Grozny, Defence Minister Igor Rodionov disowned the plan.As Rodionov spoke, his mentor in the Kremlin, security chief Alexander Lebed, was heading for talks with Chechen rebel leaders -- and Russian warplanes had already started bombing.In late 1994, then-defence minister Pavel Grachev, a strong advocate of the use of force against the rebels, told Yeltsin he needed two hours and a regiment of paratroopers to crush them.But Russia, faced with resolute guerrillas defending their own mountainous land, needed six months and many more regiments to take control of the bulk of Chechnya -- a region of about a million people and half the size of Belgium.The army, under Grachev's defence ministry, dominated the initial stages of the operation launched on December 11, 1994. However, heavy losses and heavy going subdued Grachev's optimism.Once his forces had captured the ruins of Grozny in April he declared the \"military stage\" of the operation over and said his colleague, then-interior minister Viktor Yerin, would take charge of stamping out remaining pockets of resistance.From that point on, the rival ministries, defence and interior, have had to struggle to coordinate their actions -- which many observers see as a factor in Russian setbacks in Chechnya.When the separatists took Grozny back on August 6, interior ministry officials complained that the army refused to help them. Defence ministry officials were quoted as saying their forces in Chechnya had been told not to interfere until they received a written request from the interior ministry.There are no published official figures on troop numbers in the region. Pavel Felgenhauer, military analyst for the newspaper Sevodnya, has estimated there are around 20,000 interior ministry troops, including police, and 19,000 defence ministry troops.Both ministries' forces have heavy artillery, armoured vehicles and helicopter gunships. The defence ministry also has combat aircraft.Against them, the rebels say, is a guerrilla force of less than 10,000.Theoretically both sets of Russian troops report to the commander of the Joint Group of the Federal Forces in Chechnya, a position now occupied by Lieutenant-General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov. He returned from holiday on Wednesday and appeared to approve of the ultimatum his deputy had issued on Monday.There are no rules on whom the commander of the Joint Group, nominated directly by the president, reports to.\"He receives a few orders from the defence minister, a few orders from the interior minister, a few orders from Yeltsin and is free to choose which ones to carry out,\" a military expert in the region, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.In theory Yeltsin, who is supreme commander of the Russian armed forces, is in overall charge. But the 65-year-old president has never claimed day-to-day control and policy has swung back and forth between peace talks and main force.After the rebel attack on Grozny, Yeltsin, out of the public eye for weeks and perhaps keen to be seen resolving the chain of command, gave his new security supremo Alexander Lebed sweeping powers to end the crisis.Quite how this is supposed to work remains unclear.The defence and interior ministers report directly to Yeltsin, not to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.Lebed is secretary to the Security Council, a non-government body chaired by Yeltsin and including the defence and interior ministers. But his formal powers have not been publicly defined.Yeltsin issued a decree last week saying the Security Council would coordinate all operations in Chechnya. Yet days later, the president ignored a demand by Lebed that Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov be sacked for the bungling over the conflict.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDEF", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The list also includes Singaporean firms Total Access Communications and Singapore Telecom.Newspaper reports say the government has selected PT Cellnet Nusantara, controlled by President Suharto's daughter Siti Hutami Endang Hadiningsih and his brother-in-law Sudwikatmono to try the techonology in Jakarta. Cellnet is linked to Motorola.They say state-owned PT Inti has been picked to try the system in Indonesia's second city of Surabaya, in East Java.Ministry spokesman Dardjito would not confirm the reports or say when tenders for nine service areas throughout Indonesia would be announced.\"We are still working on it. All the papers are still being processed,\" Dardjito said without elaborating.A spokeswoman for PT Bukaka Teknik Utama said it was considering joining Singapore Telecom in a bid to win the tender, but declined to give details.Cellnet and most of the other firms said to be bidding on the tender were not available for comment.Tourism, Post and Telecommunications Minister Joop Ave said recently he was urging the bidders to link-up with existing GSM operators. He also said the government may divide the project into regional segments and choose winners for each segment.  Analysts say it would be more profitable to link-up with the current GSM operators to reduce investment costs by using some existing facilities. But industry sources said none of the three current operators were on the list of tender participants.The number of cellular telephone subscribers in Indonesia has surged in the past three years to an estimated 350,000.

The Department said it would sell $18.75 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday and $12.5 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday. The auctions will settle on September 3.The market took the announcement in stride.\"Everyone's accustomed to the two's and five's,\" said Ricchuito. \"There was no increase in the auction size and while they'll raise ($3.45 billion in) new cash, a lot of it is rollover,\" he said.Economists said the market would pay close attention to Thursday's weekly jobless claims data.  Last week, the four-week moving average for new jobless claims dipped to a seven-year low.Economists polled by Reuters estimated, on average, that new jobless claims rose to 331,000 in the week ended August 17, from 321,000 a week earlier.\"There may be a little concern that if the claims numbers don't rise in the next couple of weeks, August economic data might be stronger than expected,\" said Joshua Feinman, vice president and global markets economist at Bankers Trust.\"If claims stay (near 320,000), it's a cinch that the August data will be stronger than expected,\" he said.  Rupert said a low jobless claims number could suggest a healthy (August monthly) U.S. payrolls number.Current estimates for August non-farm payroll growth center in the area of 225,000 to 275,000 new jobs.For the time being, investors seem content to let the market trade in its current range.Rupert defined that range as being between 6.75 percent and 6.875 percent on the long bond yield.\"We still bouncing around in a range,\" Feiman concurred. \"People are not ready to push the market higher from here.\"  At the short end of the maturity range, three- and six-month bill rates each fell two basis points to 5.01 percent and 5.08 percent, respectively.The 6-1/4 percent two-year note slipped 2/32 to 100-15/32, ending with a 5.99 percent yield.The five-year note fell 5/32 to 101-3/32, yielding 6.36 percent.The 10-year note traded down 10/32 at 102-24/32, for a yield of 6.62 percent.-- 212-859-1679", "label": ["M12", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

At the end of August, Mexico still owed $3.5 billion to the United States that was backed by proceeds from its crude oil and petrochemical products.Rubin said the Mexican government's tax and money supply policies were on track and its economy was regaining strength.\"Though the effects of the deep recession of 1995 are still being felt, an economic recovery is under way in Mexico,\" Rubin said, adding its financial markets were strong in August and stock market prices had risen.But Mexico's banking system \"remains strained,\" the report to Congress said, and a restructuring effort continued.  The Treasury report made no mention of the possible impact on the Mexican loans from a wave of rebel attacks in recent days in Mexico that left many dead and wounded.Earlier on Friday, the White House condemned the rebel violence while the State Department said it saw no threat to Mexico's economic and political stability.Mexico's security forces were expected to be on alert on Sunday, when President Ernesto Zedillo was due to give his second annual State of the Nation address.The Republican-controlled Congress opposed offering loans to Mexico when it entered a financial crisis late in 1994, claiming they would never be repaid, but the Clinton administration organized a bailout effort on its own.Treasury agreed at that time to make monthly reports to Congress on Mexico's progress toward regaining economic stability.", "label": ["E212", "E21", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "The dollar edged down against the mark on Wednesday and German stocks suffered after a respected German business climate survey dampened expectations that the Bundesbank would ease credit this week.The Ifo institute said its West Germany business climate index for July jumped to 94.1 from 90.4 in June -- far exceeding economists' expectations for a figure of around 91.0.The index had been hotly awaited in financial markets, with many players looking for a weak figure. That would have made it more likely the German central bank would cut its main money market interest rate, the repo, at its regular council meeting on Thursday.The news boosted the mark against the dollar and also stengthened the German currency against other European currencies. The dollar later drifted down to below 1.4840 marks, having earlier approached the 1.49 level.Weaker expectations of a German rate cut also hit the Frankfurt bourse, where the main Dax index lost about 17 points or more than half a percentage point.London, Europe's largest bourse, which closed on Tuesday at a record high, settled about six points up by early afternoon after British retail trade figures provided Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke with further ammunition if he wants to cut lending rates again.The government reported an unexpected 0.6 percent decline in retail sales in July. Economists were forecasting a 0.2 percent rise in sales and said the decline raised the possibility of a base rate cut on September 4, when British monetary authorities next meet.The blue chip FTSE 100 index ended at a record 3,883.2 points on Tuesday and was further underpinned as the market breathed a sigh of relief that U.S. monetary authorities refrained from raising U.S. interest rates overnight.However, traders said a modest correction was in order, as the FTSE -- up almost five percent so far this month -- had settled higher for six of the last seven trading sessions.\"We need a correction in the next two or three days,\" one trader said. \"But no one is looking to sell, they're just cautious.

Weaker expectations of a German rate cut also dimmed prospects that the Bank of France would trim its own rates, particularly in view of recent French franc weakness.On the foreign exchanges damage to the dollar/mark was limited by the belief that, on balance, the Bundesbank will still opt for a credit easing despite the Ifo survey, and by Tuesday's news of a sharp narrowing of the U.S. trade gap.\"The dollar is doing well and holding in,\" said David Coleman, chief eocnomist at CIBC Wood Gundy.\"OK, it's not making any progress above 1.49 but you can't expect it to with the Bundesbank overshadowing everything.\"Analysts said that while any German credit easing would be small in terms of the whole economy, it would have an important psychological impact on the foreign exchange market and be taken as a sign that the Bundesbank wants to take some of the steam out of the mark.CURRENCIES AT 1200 GMTThe dollar was at 1.4840 marks and 108.30 yen compared with 1.4884 marks and 108.28 yen at the London close on Tuesday.STOCK MARKETS AT 1200 GMTThe Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares had risen 6.6 points to 3,889.8.In Paris, the CAC-40 share index dropped 16.14 to 2,002.4.The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was down 16.52 at 2,543.74.PRECIOUS METALSGold fixed at $387.45 versus $387.55 at its close in London on Tuesday.

{"token": "The Australian government announced on Tuesday a 15 percent tax surcharge on the retirement savings of wealthy people to raise about A$500 million annually as part of an overhaul of the superannuation (pension) system.The measure, outlined in the 1996/97 (July/June) budget announced on Tuesday, accounts for the bulk of net savings to be achieved under the overhaul, which also changes the tax treatment of employer contributions to retirement funds.  The budget papers list the effect from all the changes would be an increase in revenue of A$523 million in 1997/98 -- the first full year of the new arrangements -- rising to A$582 million in 1999/2000.The surcharge, to be phased in for annual incomes between A$70,000 and A$85,000 and to apply in full for people earning above that, will raise A$480 million in 1997/98, rising to A$530 in 1999/2000.The government estimates it will affect 355,000 tax-payers and will apply to the superannuation contributions made by, or on behalf of, high-income earners.  \"The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation (retirement savings) fairer,\" Treasurer Peter Costello said in his budget speech.He also confirmed in his budget speech the government would honour the previous administration's pledge to make public contributions to workers' retirement savings.These contributions, originally meant to have been delivered by way of tax cuts by the former Labor government, were costed in the 1995/96 budget at A$1.1 billion in 1998/99.  Costello also said the government would raise the age limit for retirement contributions to 70 from 65 years and allow people on low incomes to take a wage rise in lieu of employers paying mandatory contributions into their retirement funds.The government will also allow a tax rebate for contributions made on behalf of a low-income spouse.The standard contribution limit, which enables employers to claim tax relief on their contributions to a worker's retirement savings, has been dropped, Costello said.This change in the tax treatment of employer contributions will raise about A$40 million annually, the budget papers show.  He also confirmed that financial institutions would be able to create retirement savings accounts as a simple, low-cost superannuation product.-- Canberra bureau 616-273-2730", "label": ["E211", "E21", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

They were flown there by helicopter on Friday, 24 hours after the crash, once a break in bad weather allowed them to move in.\"We are digging the dead out of the snow,\" deputy governor Rune Baard Hansen told reporters.Tore Dahlberg, a doctor who went to the scene, told Norwegian television the wreck area was \"a terrible sight\".\"We saw the mangled remains of people in the wreckage,\" he said. Getting the bodies down from the mountain is a priority.\"The first thing is that the dead will be counted and tagged. Then the victims will be bagged, sent by helicopter to Longyear and afterwards flown to Tromsoe (in mainland Norway) for autopsy,\" said police coordinator Ivar Follestad.Most of the three-engined plane, smashed and broken, is stranded on a mountaintop some seven km (four miles) east of Longyear. The tail section broke off and slid down the steep mountainside, scarring the surface and blackening the snow.The windblown, chilly streets of this tiny Norwegian mining town were all but deserted and flags flew at half-mast beneath a brooding, clouded sky on Friday.The close-knit, hardy Norwegian and Russian mining communities on the island were plunged into grief and shock by the worst air disaster in Norway's history.The island's governor, Ann-Kristin Olsen, choked back tears as she told reporters of the heartbreak she witnessed when visiting the stricken Russian mining communities on Friday.The miners were on their way to start work in the Russian towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden. Fewer than 3,000 people live on Spitzbergen, which has one of the world's harshest climates and lies some 500 miles (800 km) off the northern tip of Norway.The crash site is inaccessible by land and there is a danger of avalanches and from polar bears which roam Spitzbergen's icy wastes, rescue officials said.Officials said it could days or weeks to bring all the bodies down from the mountain. Police said mountain climbers could be needed to reach the tail section of the plane.The Tupolev Tu-154 was bringing miners and some of their families, 76 of them from Ukraine, to work in a Russian open-cast mine. Spitzbergen is governed by Norway but Russia has rights of access under an international treaty from the 1920s.In Kiev, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma declared Friday a national day of mourning for the dead miners and their families.", "label": ["CCAT", "GCAT", "GDIS"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The age groups are also more or less the same as those in Belgium.\"South African paedophile Gert van Rooyen and his lover Joey Haarhof were linked by police to the disappearance of the girls, aged 11 to 13.

{"token": "The Norwegian bourse, one of the smallest in Europe, is worried that foreign investors are trading increasingly in shares listed in Oslo through channels other than stock exchange members.The bourse plans to introduce several measures, including possibly extended opening hours, in an effort to persuade foreign investors to use the trading system more, said bourse director Kjell Froensdal.\"We are becoming more and more dependent on the foreigners and their way of trading,\" he told Reuters. \"We must make sure we still are on top of their list.\"About 60 percent of transactions involving shares listed in Oslo is now taking place outside the system, according to the Norwegian Registry of Securities (VPS). Foreign investors are believed to account for most of the outside transactions.Foreign investments now represent 35 percent of the market value of bourse stock, up from 21 percent 10 years ago. The foreigners, including British and U.S. pension funds, invest in everything from Hitec ASA, a small offshore technology company, to industrial giant Norsk Hydro ASA.\"We have to be able to reach the foreign investors and to ensure they find it worthwhile to go to a Norwegian broker and have the order as part of the liquidity in Oslo,\" he said. \"The broker system is very important. In the foreseeable future we are basing ourselves on the representative system.\"VPS statistics show the figure on transactions through other channels than Oslo Bourse members jumped from 36 percent in March to 60 percent in April and has since stayed high.Bourse official Anders Brodin said two investors could trade with each other without going through an Oslo broker.\"It seems this proportion has increased,\" he said. \"The question is if this is a coincidence or do we see a bigger proportion of shares being traded outside the bourse?\"Plans to extend the daily trading session by one hour to 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) have upset brokers, who complain about long hours already. The bourse opens at 10 a.m. (0800gmt).Froensdal said no final decision had been made on trading hours but said he was concerned that other stock exchanges may be taking over business from Oslo in the late afternoon.\"You are an investor. You call your broker after 4 p.m. to say you want this order done today. Oslo is closed. But they are open in New York, in London and Stockholm. It is stupid to give away this hour,\" he said.With 170 listed companies and a total market value of 318 billion ($49.66) crowns, the Oslo Bourse is among Europe's smallest. Stock turnover in July was worth 12.70 billion crowns compared with 62.53 billion in neighbouring Sweden. Oslo's bond market is also small in a European as well as a Nordic perspective.The Total stock index has gone up 12 percent so far this year -- roughly on par with major markets.Thirty three broker firms are represented on the floor, with brokers using telephones to buy and sell. Trading takes place physically only in the downtown neo-classic building that is home to the Oslo Bourse, founded in 1819.\"We have a rather cumbersome system,\" Froensdal said. \"It takes a few minutes in Oslo to make a trade. In another market place it takes maybe seconds (for a computer) to match equal orders.\"Decentralised, off-floor trade will be introduced once the stock exchange gets a new computer system, perhaps next year. It will allow for overseas brokers to become members of the bourse.\"Our strategy is to decentralise trade, extend trading hours, increase efficiency,\" Froensdal said.The bourse in March cancelled a 51 million crown contract with Logica Plc for a new computer trading system because of alleged delays caused by the British software company. It was to have been in place this year.\"The cancellation of the Logica contract was very unfortunate and a setback,\" Froensdal said. \"Since April we have been in contact with possible other suppliers.\"He said the bourse would boil its options down to a shortlist of one or two possible suppliers and then enter talks.\"My experience is that negotiations can easily drag on and I don't want to predict how long this will take. But it is clear that the shortlist must be ready this year,\" he said.The most imminent problem is trading in equity derivatives. Last December the Oslo Bourse and the Norwegian Futures and Options Clearing House agreed to set up a link with the Swedish derivatives exchange OM and its London equivalent OMLX.The system, under which foreigners will be able to trade in Oslo derivatives via London and Stockholm, goes into operation on February 14 next year. Oslo handles only 6,000 contracts a day to make it one of Europe's smallest derivatives markets.\"This has been a disappointing market since we opened it in 1990. We hope this opening to Stockholm and especially London will increase the number of players,\" Froensdal said.For all the new thinking in the old bourse house, part of the order books will probably stay closed for everyone except the brokers, Froensdal said.\"In Norway we have traditionally taken the position that full insight into the order books is an advantage enjoyed by the brokers. They know the market and they take a certain risk when they take positions,\" he said. \"It is not certain that the market would gain in the long run from complete transparency.\" ($1=6.403 Norwegian Crown)", "label": ["M11", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Forces of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) were leaving.U.N. sources said about 12,000 Iraqi troops were aiding the KDP to capture the PUK stronghold.Residents reported heavy casualties from shelling and said terrified civilians were fleeing.PUK leader Jalal Talabani told Reuters by telephone from Arbil that he had warned Washington three days in advance that the Iraqi forces were prepared to attack Arbil.\"The Americans promised to attack them (the Iraqis). They did not act decisively,\" Talabani said.Talabani said he had not yet given up hope for U.S. intervention, adding a meeting was expected in Washington in several hours' time to review the situation. He did not elaborate.There was no immediate reaction from the United States to Iraq's attack on Arbil which lies about 20 km (12 miles) north of the 36th parallel -- the line that Iraqi forces have been barred by allied forces from crossing since just after the end of the 1991 Gulf War when Iraq tried to seize control of the area.U.S., British and French warplanes are based in southern Turkey under Operation Provide Comfort to protect the zone.KDP leader Massoud Barzani said his faction was being backed by Iraqi heavy armour and artillery, a senior U.N. official in Baghdad said.\"They have confirmed to us that Iraqi troops are taking part in the attack on Arbil...We got the information from KDP leaders in KDP headquarters in Saladdin,\" the official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.The two factions, split along political and tribal lines, have a long history of fighting each other and forging shifting alliances with the main powers in the region -- Iraq and Iran.The Iraqi government in Baghdad said it had decided to \"provide support and military aid\" for the KDP in its fight against the PUK.In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said Iraq's military intervention was in response to a plea from Barzani to President Saddam Hussein to back him militarily against attacks by Iran and Talabani.The KDP has long sought to break the grip of the PUK over Arbil, the seat of a Kurdish government and parliament that was created jointly by the two factions in elections after the 1991 Gulf War after a rebellion against Iraqi rule.The United States twice negotiated a ceasefire between the two rival Kurdish factions this month. But there were repeated violations. The two factions met at the U.S. embassy in London on Friday for talks to consolidate the ceasefire.President Bill Clinton on Friday ordered the U.S. military to prepare for possible deployment in the Gulf and a White House spokesman said Washington was carefully monitoring Iraqi troop activity in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.A U.S. Navy spokesman in Bahrain said American forces, combat vessels and fighter planes patrolling the Gulf could respond to threatening Iraqi troop movements in northern Iraq immediately if called upon,\"We would be able to respond immediately to the threat in northern Iraq. Within hours,\" Commander T. McCreary, spokesman for the U.S. Fifth Fleet based in Bahrain, told Reuters.\"We will consider any aggression by Iraq to be a matter of very grave concern,\" White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters on Friday. 311421 GMT aug 96", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Michael spent 10 minutes with him and his explanation was unsatisfactory,\" said Illingworth, who said he did not know if the player had spent the night at home or in the team hotel.Lloyd confirmed Lewis, who lives less than three miles away from the Oval in Chelsea Harbour, had not phoned to warn he would be late. An England official rang Lewis on his mobile phone, but discovered it had been switched to ansaphone mode.Lewis, who owns a top-of-the-range Mercedes convertible, was also late for the first one-day international against India earlier in the season.Despite a fine piece of fielding which brought a run-out early in the first hour of the day on Sunday, his chances of making England's tour to Zimbabwe and New Zealand now look remote.\"It won't do them any good,\" Illingworth said dryly. \"They're not decisions you like to make. But we have to get the message through that the rewards of playing for England are high and the discipline has to be there as well.\"The mercurial Lewis, 28, has endured an increasingly disappointing season after being recalled to the England set-up, only just managing to hold his place for the Oval after an unimpressive display at Headingley in the previous test.The all-rounder, who has played 32 tests and 51 one-day internationals, is not exactly a stranger to controversy but, ironically, has claimed to have rediscovered his motivation since moving back to London to live closer to his family following stints with Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire.The Lewis rumpus totally overshadowed the surprise inclusion of Graham Lloyd, the coach's son, in a much-changed squad of 13.Four others in the team contesting the final test at the Oval have been either dropped or rested, with Lancashire batsman Lloyd, Surrey all-rounder Adam Hollioake and Headley all in line for international debuts.Darren Gough, Matthew Maynard, Ronnie Irani and Peter Martin have been recalled to the international set-up, with Dominic Cork, Nasser Hussain, John Crawley and Ian Salisbury all missing along with 12th man Andy Caddick and test discard Graeme Hick.Illingworth said Cork had been left out as much for his expensive recent bowling figures as anything else and indicated the Derbyshire player might be left behind to work on his fitness rather than touring with England this winter.Squad: Michael Atherton (captain), Alec Stewart, Graham Thorpe, Nick Knight, Graham Lloyd, Matthew Maynard, Ronnie Irani, Adam Hollioake, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Peter Martin, Dean Headley, Alan Mullally.", "label": ["GCAT", "GSPO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The teachers are mad at Bob Dole. In conduct unbecoming a classroom they hiss and boo the very mention of his name.At least that is what happened on Tuesday when Vice President Al Gore addressed a group of teachers at the Democratic National Convention.Two weeks ago, Dole picked the fight in his address accepting the Republican presidential nomination, telling the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers:\"If education were a war, you would be losing it. If it were a business, you would be driving it into bankruptcy. If it were a patient, it would be dying.\"In attacking union opposition to giving parents financial help to let them choose which schools their children attend and injecting what some see as capitalistic competition into the education system, Dole took on one of the most powerful forces in the Democratic party.He also staked out an issue of interest to young parents and turned the school choice debate into a major campaign batleground.About 550 of the delegates to this week's Democratic National Convention belong to one of the two unions, which together have more than 3 million members. The NEA says many of its members are Republicans, at least in name.Gore told the teacher-delegates on Tuesday they were being made scapegoats by Dole who instead should be concentrating on making public schools \"the best in the world, bar none.\"\"We oppose vouchers because we will not tolerate an assault on the financial structure of educational opportunity,\" Gore said.He called the school choice idea a \"fradulent\" and \"misguided\" concept that would drain funds from the school system. The room sizzled with hisses and boos every time he mentioned Dole and running mate Jack Kemp. One delegate hoisted a hand-lettered sign reading \"mad and mobilized.\"The teachers unions have traditionally backed Democratic candidates at most levels, and Dole might not have been able to count on much support from that quarter in the first place. But union members said the attack has triggered an anger that has resulted in a unified front for President Bill Clinton.Mary Bergan, president of the California Federation of Teachers, said she was \"very surprised\" that Dole elected to single out the teachers unions for a special attack in his acceptance speech.\"They had tried to make such a big deal of inclusion in that speech. They tried to make a distinction between teachers and their unions, which most people don't make and a lot of our members sure don't make,\" she told Reuters.\"A lot of our members and a lot of NEA members happen to be Republicans, so he really solidified people, brought people over to Clinton in the education community for sure,\" said Bergan, who lives in Oakland, California.A poll meanwhile released in Washington by Phi Delta Kappa International, an educational fraternity, and conducted by the Gallup organization found that 61 percent of those polled opposed the idea of allowing students to attend private schools at public expense while 36 percent supported it.The group said a similar poll in 1995 showed 65 percent opposed and that the opposition stood at 74 percent in 1993.Clinton on Tuesday proposed a $2.75 billion literacy campaign for children that would involve hiring spcialists to to help communities provide extra reading help before and after school for 3 million children at 20,000 schools.The Dole camp fired back immediately, indicating it was not about to let the teachers unions off the hook.\"Bill Clinton is admitting that our schools cannot accomplish the most basic task of literacy. But, instead of pursuing fundamental reform -- by confronting the teachers' unions and embracing school choice -- Bill Clinton announces a new government program and a new pot of money for the unions,\" the Dole campaign said.\"By drawing education into the political discourse, Bill Clinton has drawn a clear distinction between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton.

The Hawaii-based U.S. Pacific Command said in a statement that a recent visit by a U.S. army team to train Sri Lankan soldiers was part of routine cooperation with the Sri Lankan army.Western diplomats said the current lull in the ethnic war meant the army had exhausted itself after a thrust against the rebels' Kilinochchi stronghold in the north last month.The army launched the assault soon after the LTTE overran the northeastern Mullaitivu army camp killing or capturing almost its entire garrison of 1,400 men.\"I'm not surprised to see a lull in activity by government forces,\" said a Western diplomat. \"The offensive was hastily planned.\"Government forces have remained on the outskirts of Kilinochchi for the past two weeks.Aid officials said more than 200,000 Tamils displaced by the offensive were still short of food and had no shelter.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

If approved, the tax would probably take effect by May 1997 and would raise enough money to design the runway and buy the land.The city had asked the airlines to fund construction of the runway through an increase in landing fees but the carriers, led by Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, rejected the request in June.Airport general manager Angela Gittens told the newspaper that the city wants to keep moving forward and hopes to reopen negotiations with the airlines.The added runway has become more crucial under new FAA regulations that increased the required distance between certain aircraft for safety reasons.

{"token": "Britain's sickly manufacturing sector showed a slight sign of recovery in August, with firms reporting a modest rise in overall demand, the Confederation of British Industry said Friday.But its August industrial trends survey found orders were still well below normal levels for this time of year, hit in particular by sluggish demand for British goods abroad.Only 19 percent of firms said orders rose, compared with 29 percent who said they fell. Firms have regarded orders as below normal for the time of year for 12 months in a row.\"Although manufacturing demand has improved to its best level so far this year, companies will find it difficult to raise more than one cheer,\" said Sudhir Junankar, associate director of economic analysis at the CBI.He said total order books remained significantly below normal despite some improvement in domestic demand.The survey showed demand from overseas had weakened further, leaving export order books in their worst state since February 1994. Junankar said the European market in particular showed little sign of improvement, with France and Germany very weak.Excessive stock levels continued to dog the industry but fewer firms than last month reported stocks of finished goods were more than adequate to meet expected demand.Given the persistently low level of demand, firms said they did not expect to raise their prices over the next four months.But the beleaguered manufacturing sector will contribute significantly to output growth next year, the CBI said in its latest quarterly economic forecast, also released Friday.The CBI forecasts manufacturing output will grow by 3.9 percent next year, a marginal downward revision from its previous forecast made in May, while its 1996 forecast has been revised down to 0.6 percent from 1.0 percent at the last round.Output grew by 2.2 percent in 1995.The CBI also forecast steady, unspectacular growth in gross domestic product to continue in 1996, but said there was no need for another interest rate cut.\"Our stance is that interest rates should be left on hold,\" said Kate Barker, the CBI's chief economic adviser. \"The risk of a new recession is only slightIt forecast that GDP would grow 2.0 percent in 1996 with activity picking up to 3.1 percent in 1997.", "label": ["E31", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

I don't think (the delay)  bears any relation to the merits of the case or what the judge is deciding,\" said Chris Lyman, attorney at Kilpatrick and Cody, which represents 93 investors who brought the lawsuit.Lyman told Reuters he expected a ruling between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT and 2100 GMT) on Friday.\"I think think he's giving it careful thought and study,\" he added.\"The opinion is expected to be issued in the afternoon of Friday, August 23,\" the federal court said in a one-sentence statement.\"I don't discuss these things,\" Judge Payne said, when asked by a Reuter reporter about the delay.Local lawyers for Lloyd's were not immediately available for comment and did not return telephone calls.The 93 investors or Names -- individuals who pledge assets to back the insurance policies sold at Lloyd's -- are seeking to block the reorganization plan whereby Lloyd's would reinsure billions in liabilities by creating a new reinsurance company, Equitas.(Corrects to indicate that investors are not from Virginia).Under the plan, the investors are being asked to pay up to $150,000 to help fund Equitas. The Virginia investors filed suit instead after Lloyd's declined to provide detailed financial information about Equitas, as is required under U.S. securities laws.Judge Payne indicated his concern was that U.S. investors were adequately protected. He also scolded the Securities and Exchange Commission for not taking up the matter.Lloyd's chief executive, Ronald Sandler, admitted in court that the British Embassy had arranged a meeting in Washington between SEC and Lloyd's officials prior to the court hearing.

In an interview published in the Dubai-based daily Khaleej Times, Bhutto said any move to hold talks during the polls, ending on September 30, could send wrong signals to the Kashmiris. Bhutto attributed the cooling off of Pakistan's response to India's call for dialogue to economic preoccupations at home and India's decision to hold polls in Kashmir. Bhutto, however, advocated regional free trade and cooperation and promised not to allow economic issues to get blurred by political problems.----Business StandardWORLD BANK SAYS BUDGET A MISSED OPPORTUNITYThe World Bank said India had failed to utilise the 1996/97 national budget to initiate fiscal adjustments and said its current economic policies sent wrong signals to foreign private investors. The bank said India's large fiscal deficits might lead to an internal debt trap as real interest rates outpaced growth rate.CENTRAL BANK MOPS UP GDR FUNDS IN OFF-MARKET DEALSThe Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, had entered off-market deals to mop up excess foreign exchange inflows from recent global depository receipt issues of Indian corporates. The market intervention was to prevent the rupee from appreciating. The consequent release of rupee funds into the system was among the major factors that led to a fall in call market rates to two percent from seven percent earlier.WORLD BANK LIKELY TO PICK UP STAKE IN INFRASTRUCTURE FIRMMultilateral institutions such as the World Bank and international investment banks are slated to pick up stakes in the proposed Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC).

{"token": "A Berlin court suspended proceedings on Monday against a former member of East Germany's ruling Politburo on health grounds, dealing a new blow to attempts to bring to justice the architects of communist rule.Erich Mueckenberger, 86, is accused along with the others of being responsible for East Berlin's policy of shooting to kill refugees as they tried to flee to West Germany across the fortified frontier, and faces charges of manslaughter.The fragile health of the former head of the communist party's parliamentary group meant he was able to spend only short periods in court, slowing the trial of his co-defendants. These include the last hardline communist leader, Egon Krenz.Former party ideology chief Kurt Hager, 84, had already been released from the proceedings in May because of poor health.But Mueckenberger's removal may speed up a trial which has heard just two witnesses since it began last November.Out of 66 model cases of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter on which prosecutors chose to bring charges, 51 concerned only Mueckenberger, who was one of the longest-serving Politburo members along with Hager.With just 15 cases left, there was a better chance that prosecutors could secure at least some convictions soon against the political elite who have so far eluded all attempts to make them accountable for East Germany's decades-long state tyranny.Three second-tier officials, former defence minister Heinz Kessler, his deputy Fritz Streletz and regional party boss Hans Albrecht, were sentenced to between 4-1/2 and 7-1/2 years in jail but are free pending an appeal to the constitutional court.But the late former East German leader Erich Honecker and secret police chief Erich Mielke were both deemed too ill to stand trial over the border killings.Mielke was, however, convicted for killing two policemen in street battles in 1931, and released last year.In January a court convicted Wolfgang Vogel, the East Berlin lawyer who gained fame by engineering Cold War spy swaps, of extorting property from East Germans trying to get permission to emigrate to the West.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Romania's Central Bank has eased stringent hard currency controls to restore credibility with investors but a flood of poor economic data will undermine attempts to rebuild confidence, analysts said on Thurdsay.Central Bank governor Mugur Isarescu said on Wednesday most state companies and oil firms would now be freed from the controls imposed to build up a fund to pay for fuel and gas.The exchange controls imposed earlier this month were bitterly criticised at home and abroad as confiscatory.Analysts labelled them a political attempt to prevent a repeat of last year's currency crisis, which hit energy imports and roused public outrage, ahead of November polls.\"The hard currency fund will be set up solely based on market rules,\" said Isarescu. Only companies exporting products subsidised by the state would now contribute to the fund.\"We are retaining the full retention system,\" he added.The easing appeared to be a response to Western alarm ahead of a drive to raise loans on the international market, needed to build Central Bank reserves. Romania only returned to private capital markets last year after a decade's absence.But with inflation pushing up, a plunge in exports, rising fiscal pressure and an artificially firm exchange rate, the flip-flop on exchange controls will do little to sweeten Romania's image for investors.\"The mistakes they (the government) have made show that they are pretty scared,\" said a local banker.\"The fund was not achieving much in reality and was doing a lot of harm to credibility,\" added a Western analyst. \"We still have to see if the Central Bank can limit the damage done.\"Romania is awaiting the results of a $175 million syndicated loan arranged by U.S. Citibank and Dutch ABN Amro, due to close on September 16, and would be badly affected if the market scorned the deal.Investors say the root of Romania's problems lies in a move in March to dampen inflation by keeping the domestic leu currency high through restrictions on the local forex market.The International Monetary Fund responded by withholding loan tranches and economic woes have mounted ever since.July saw a 7.5 percent price upswing that quickened year-on year inflation to 40.3 percent, a 16.1 percent drop in exports and higher wages.Hard currency squeezes triggered lower imports, which pinched industrial output, down 6.7 percent last month.A wage and pension indexation pushed up the budget deficit, triggering its revision to bring it into line with higher inflation and costs. Data on the new budget is unavailable.The hard currency fund further damaged export efforts already hit by the artificially high rate of the leu. Oil companies in particular were finding it impossible to fund their imports ahead of Romania's harsh winter.It was not clear how the relaxation of the measures would affect companies attempts to find hard currency to fund imports. Economists say little will improve until the leu is allowed to float freely.The leu has inched down since the March restrictions, hitting 3,155/65 to the dollar on the interbank market, while more realistic retail prices hover near 3,550.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "M13", "M132", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "President Bill Clinton, pledging that the law would follow child molesters wherever they went, said on Saturday a temporary system to keep track of sex offenders would be in place within six months.The national database would be compiled from information supplied by each state, while a new computer network would allow police to determine quickly and efficiently whether an individual was a registered sex offender anywhere in the United States, Clinton said in his weekly radio address.\"Deadly criminals don't stay within state lines, so neither should law enforcement's tools to stop them,\" he said.Clinton's announcement was an interim step in the establishment of a permanent National Sex Offender Registry due to be completed by mid-1999.This file, when fully operational, would include state-of-the-art identification techniques such as DNA, fingerprint matching and mug shots, Justice Department officials said.The idea of a national listing grew out of the 1994 crime bill that required each state to create a registry of those convicted of sexual assaults. It received a boost in May when Clinton signed a law requiring states to notify communities when sex offenders moved into the neighbourhood.\"Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals, not just in a single state, but wherever they go, wherever they move -- so that parents and police have the warning they need to protect our children,\" the president said.Explaining how the system would work, Clinton said every time a sex offender was released, his state would force him to register. The FBI then would compile these state lists into a national database.\"Within six months, a new computer network will give states information from every other state for the very first time. ... Then they will share that information with the families and communities that have a right to know,\" he said.Republicans were quick to point out that they had proposed the federal registry earlier.\"Once again, Bill Clinton has proven to be the Xerox president,\" Christina Martin, the Dole campaign's deputy press secretary, said. \"For the second time on the same subject, he actually lifted a page out of the 1992 Republican platform.\"But Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas praised the move, which mirrored legislation he introduced last April with Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware.\"Bill Clinton and I disagree on many critically important policy matters, and while I cannot judge his intentions in adopting our sex predator tracking system now instead of lending his backing when it was introduced ... I am pleased that this tracking system will now soon go into effect,\" Gramm said in a statement.Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have voiced fears that the national registry planned by the Clinton administration would infringe on Constitutional protections, but the president said on Saturday more than local solutions were necessary to stop sexual predators.\"This national registry sends a simple message to those who would prey on our children; The law will follow you wherever you go,\" he said.Clinton, seeking to promote his anti-crime credentials in this presidential campaign season, noted that he already had undertaken \"aggressive\" measures to reduce the crime rate, take guns off the streets and put more police officers on the beat.But he said nothing was more threatening to families, communities and basic human values than sex offenders who victimised children.\"Study after study tell us that they often repeat the same crimes,\" Clinton said. \"That's why we have to stop sex offenders before they commit their next crime, to make our children safe and give their parents peace of mind.\"", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Italy's agro-industry and chemical giant Montedison SpA returned to the limelight on Thursday as its shares rose sharply with analysts saying the stock was now a good short-term investment after recent share stake sales.Two major shareholders have been selling shares in Montedison, and analysts suspect the hand of Montedison's largest shareholder the newly-named Compart and Italy's top deal-making merchant bank Mediobanca behind the move.Rebel shareholder Luca Padulli and U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch have sold shares while the ex-Ferruzzi Compart has increased its hold over the group, signalling that Mediobanca's recovery plan for Compart/Montedison is back on track.Montedison shares rose up 2.56 percent to 1,025 lire and Compart 4.64 percent firmer to 656 lire by mid afternoon with investors eyeing less volatile times for its recently rocky share price, and seeing further consolidation of the group's sprawling structure at top of the agenda.Padulli, who heads hedge fund group Codelouf & Co, rocked Italy's cosy business establishment in May by pushing for the break up the large conglomerate to unlock shareholder value. Padulli then held a 4.8 percent stake of Montedison.After Montedison's top management rejected the break-up plan, analysts suspect Padulli was offered a way to get out of Montedison, and it was revealed late Wednesday that his shareholding had slipped to 0.12 percent.\"It seems Padulli was offered a way out, and the Mediobanca plan is back on the rails. Its good news for Montedison but shows that nothing changes in Italy and the old boy connection is still secure,\" said a head trader at leading Italian broker.Over the last few months, Compart's holding in Montedison had risen to 33 percent from around 31 percent while the latest records show Mediobanca's share of Montedison at four percent.Mediobanca led a group of Italian banks to rescue Ferruzzi and Montedison from the brink of collapse in 1993 and they now control 70 percent of Compart shares. The Mediobanca-led rescue plan was to sell off non-core business to cut debt and return both groups to profitable growth.\"Clearly, Compart and Mediobanca have increased their influence over Montedison. The question now is what is the next move,\" said one industry analyst in Milan.Some suspect a Compart/Montedison merger is back on the agenda after a similar plan last summer called SuperGemina was adandoned after accounting fraud was unearthed at the merger vehicle Gemina SpA, but a more limited merger just between Compact and Montedison could be a simpler move, they suggest.Merrill Lynch held 3.8 percent of Montedison at the time of the Montedison's annual meeting in June, but then sold 1.7 percent a few days ago and was thought to have sold a 1.52 percent block of 60 million Montedison shares yesterday. Merrill have said only they have \"under two percent\" of Montedison.Analysts pointed out that with two shareholders, not believed to be firm holders of Montedison, reducing their holdings the focus has returned to Montedison's warrants.Montedison stands to gain 1,050 billion lire ($690 million) from the exercising of warrants held by the market by the end of this year, but only if the shares hold above 1,000 lire.Dealers say Montedison is now a good short-term investment with the company eager to keep the shares above 1,000 lire to gain the financial benefits from the exercising of the warrants.($1=1,519 lire)", "label": ["C152", "C15", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "German prosecutors hoping to convict former East Berlin spymaster Markus Wolf of Cold War skulduggery after failing with treason charges said on Friday they had added a third kidnapping to their case against him.The Federal Prosecutors Office said it had charged Wolf with playing a key role in the brutal 1962 kidnapping of a Stasi (Ministry for State Security) officer who fled to the West.Prosecutors failed to get him convicted on charges of treason and espionage three years ago but in March came up with new charges of kidnapping in their second attempt to nail East Berlin's legendary spy chief since German unification in 1990.\"There is no doubt these charges are enough to bring Wolf to trial in Duesseldorf again,\" said Rolf Hannich, a spokesman for federal prosecutors speaking by telephone from Karlsruhe.\"But there are very complicated legal matters at issue and it must be decided whether he is to be judged according to former East German or West German law for the new charges,\" Hannich said, adding that a trial date had not yet been set.Germany's highest court threw out a six-year jail sentence against Wolf, saying he could not be convicted for spying against the Federal Republic of Germany because he had not violated the laws of East Germany -- his country at the time.It ruled last year that the fact that he had become the citizen of his former arch-enemy did not mean he could be charged according to the law of his new homeland for things he did as an East German citizen.The supreme court, however, left prosecutors the option of charging Wolf, 73, who now earns a living as an author and frequent chat show guest, with other offences which were criminal in both halves of divided Germany.Wolf, who ran Eastern Europe's most efficient Cold War espionage machine, is said to have inspired John le Carre's fictional character Karla, the Soviet intelligence chief against whom British spymaster George Smiley fought a battle of wits.Le Carre has dismissed the story as \"nonsense\" although any of the three kidnapping operations prosecutors say he supervised might qualify as the plot for a classic Cold War spy-thriller.Prosecutors say that by piecing together witness statements and fragments of documents they have enough evidence to show that Wolf was behind the abduction of former Stasi officer Walter Thraene from Austria back to communist East Germany.Thraene and his girlfriend were lured to a hideout and beaten unconscious before being spirited back to East Berlin, Hannich said. Thraene's girlfriend could not be identified, he said.Thraene spent more than 10 years in prison in East Germany and his girlfriend more than three years.Prosecutors say Wolf issued the orders and directed the operation. To cover up his tracks, Wolf destroyed incriminating documents, Hannich said.Thraene had been demoted in 1962 because of his love affair, which at the time was regarded as being at odds with the Socialist morality in the ex-Soviet satellite state and the rules of working for an intelligence service.The couple fled to Austria a few months later.Prosecutors in March accused Wolf of approving the kidnapping of Christa Trapp, a German translator at the U.S. High Commission in West Berlin, in 1955 to persuade her to work for them in return for pay.They also accused his ministry of forcing Georg Angerer, an East German typesetter who worked in Nazi-occupied Norway in World War Two as interpreter for the Gestapo secret police, to sign defamatory statements in 1959 about Willy Brandt.Prosecutors say Angerer was arrested in 1959 on fictional manslaughter charges and, after weeks of detention, gave in to pressure to sign the statements about the future chancellor, who spent some time in Norway during the war.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

No hearings are scheduled for Wednesday.The hearing is the latest in a series on Lloyd's recovery plan. The program has been approved in Britain and in other U.S. federal courts, but 93 of about 3,000 U.S. investors filed suit in the Virginia court to block it.Lloyd's needs to pass the rescue proposal by August 28.

He testified for a total of six hours on Monday and Tuesday.Under the rescue proposal, Lloyd's would reinsure liabilities, including pollution and asbestos-related claims, in the United States through a new company called Equitas. But investors found the offer short on details.They said Lloyd's had not yet provided adequate pro forma financial statements for Equitas or solid information on such points as who will operate it, what its costs will be or how its funds and proceeds will be used.\"We are here to try to make sure we get that information,\" said Steve Clay, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs.Lloyd's attorney Michael Rauch told Payne it would take months for the information to be sent to investors.Lloyd's said it was willing to allow investors to sue in Britain if fraud was found in its restructuring.Lloyd's executives expect the liabilities to be wiped out in 30 years and any money left over would go to charities. The names of the charities are to be put before Payne before he rules.Sandler said Equitas would have a set of trustees to run it and one Lloyd's director would be among them.The legal challenge was complicated on Friday by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It refused to determine whether Lloyd's should be subject to securities laws.The judge criticized the SEC's neutral ruling and the absence of an SEC representative in the courtroom.\"What the SEC has done on this is administrative malfeasance,\" Payne said.-- New York newsroom, (212) 859-1610", "label": ["C12", "C17", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The Palestinian Authority was set up under the 1993 PLO-Israel interim peace deal.\"There has been a call for a general strike between one (1000 GMT) and three o'clock,\" Palestinian lawmaker Ahmed Hashem Zighayer told Reuters.\"This is a war that has been declared on us and we want our people to come and see the site where they declared the war.\"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, which took office in June, has said it will not allow the Authority, set up under a 1993 interim peace deal to control parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, to operate in Jerusalem.Israel's previous government held the same position but in general turned a blind eye to Palestinian Authority activity in the city.Tuesday's demolition came a day after PLO officials said they had bowed to Netanyahu's demand they close offices in Jerusalem. They said two of the three offices Israel wanted closed had been shut.Netanyahu has made closure of the three offices a condition for resuming peace negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it. It says it will never cede any part of the city. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state.

{"token": "In a bid to heal the wounds of war, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano travelled this week to a district that was the military headquarters of a guerrilla movement which for 16 years tried to topple the government.Chissano went to the remote mountainous district of Maringue on Thursday to see the people who had sheltered guerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo).It was his first venture into what diplomats call the lion's den since a 1992 peace agreement ended the war between his Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo) government and Renamo.Details of the visit were delayed because communications between the capital Maputo in the south of this southern African nation and Maringue in the centre are almost non-existent.But the Mozambique News Agency reported on Friday from the nearest sizeable town, Gorongosa, that Chissano spoke to a large crowd in Maringue \"in a careful and conciliatory manner\".The president said in his speech the difficulties that had been encountered during the two years of peace negotiations between Frelimo and Renamo were due to a lack of understanding.\"It was not easy to reach an agreement between the government and Renamo because we did not know each other.\"There were even some who were fighting in the belief that they were struggling against the Portuguese in Lourenco Marques, even though they were no longer there,\" he said.Lourenco Marques was the name for Maputo when Mozambique was a Portuguese colony.Chissano laid a strong emphasis on national unity, saying:\"There are no longer any Renamo zones, or government zones. There's just one zone and it's called Mozambique.\"One member of the crowd, a self-declared Renamo supporter named Goncalves Chongo, read out a message to the president in which he denounced foreign non-governmental aid organisations working in Mozambique, claiming they were not helping Maringue.He also protested at an alleged lack of democracy, despite the victory of Chissano and his party in elections supervised by the United Nations in 1994.But Renamo's general secretary, Francisco Xavier, was quoted in the Maputo daily Noticias on Friday as welcoming Chissano's visit, adding: \"It should put an end to speculation that the district is a threat to the peace and stability which Mozambique now enjoys.\"", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Cambodia's Supreme Court on Friday fined and jailed outspoken former editor Hen Vipheak on charges of spreading disinformation but allowed his paper to keep publishing.Judge Chan Sok upheld rulings by the municipal and appeal courts that handed down a fine of five million riels (US$2,000) and one year's imprisonment, but he overturned a decision to shut down Hen Vipheak's newspaper, Sereipheap Thmei (New Liberty).Police took Hen Vipheak to the capital's run-down T3 prison and he must now hope that co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen will support an amnesty promised earlier this year by King Norodom Sihanouk.Hen Vipheak, a member of the opposition Khmer Nation Party (KNP), is the second journalist to be jailed under the coalition government formed in 1993.Sihanouk offered an amnesty to fellow KNP member Chan Rattana, former editor of Voice of Khmer Youth, after he was jailed for a year in June for defaming the premiers. He was released a week later when Ranariddh and Hun Sen approved the amnesty.The king had promised an amnesty to a third newsman, opposition publisher Thun Bunly, but he was shot dead in May before his case came to court and the KNP claimed the unsolved killing was politically motivated.Judge Chan Sok ruled that a May 1995 article in Hen Vipheak's weekly paper, entitled \"Cambodia, the country of thieves\" and alleging top-level corruption, had insulted the country's leaders and the nation.Hen Vipheak, whose newspaper office was attacked by alleged supporters of Hun Sen in October last year, argued that the article was legitimate opinion as it was a letter from a reader.He issued a statement on Thursday predicting the Supreme Court would uphold the lower court decisions, including closure of the newspaper, \"as the plot to jail me had already been staged\".It said his detention and closure of the paper would \"show that those who are in power have moved another step towards the elimination of the freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution...and by the Paris peace accords (of 1991).\"The judge upstaged part of this prediction by allowing continued publication of the paper, one of a handful that reflect the views of the KNP, which is not recognised by the government.", "label": ["C12", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "A Chinese court will seek to recover 100,000 yuan ($12,000) from an International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff member jailed for five years for corruption, a court official said on Monday.A Chinese appeals court, in a rare move last Friday, cut the prison term of Hong Yang, a Chinese national working at the IMF, to five years from an original sentence of 11 years.Hong was jailed for accepting bribes in 1993, before he joined the IMF. He appealed the original sentence.\"(We) will continue to try to retrieve the 100,000 yuan bribe that he took,\" the official told Reuters by telephone.In Washington, the IMF said that it might ask the Chinese court to grant an early release to Hong, who was arrested while on an IMF mission to Beijing in December.The court official said Chinese courts heard cases independently and in accordance with the law.\"(We) do not put up with intervention by any government, organisation or political party,\" he said.The reduced sentence followed a brief suspension of technical assistance to China by the IMF and a hurried Beijing visit by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus to voice concern over what he described as judicial shortcomings in the case.The detention of Hong, a former employee of the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, stunned and angered IMF employees, some of whom complained bitterly that the international lending agency did little to protect its people while they were away from home.IMF management was also distressed, since it had yielded to Chinese insistence that Hong, a staff member in Washington, be included in a delegation to China.Camdessus, in a July statement, said Chinese authorities had maintained they did not know about the charge against Hong when they requested he join the delegation.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Red chip China Overseas Land and Investment Ltd is gearing up for major expansion, having raised funds three times in six months and fixed its eyes on lucrative infrastructure opportunities in China.The company plans to make a new investment every three months or so, Sam Y.L. Kwok, director and deputy general manager of the company, said in an interview with Reuters.\"There will be a gradual shift to China infrastructure,\" Kwok said.The company, whose earnings base is weighted 70-30 in Hong Kong and China property and construction projects, is looking at acquiring two highway construction projects in northern China.\"But nothing has been finalised yet,\" Kwok said.The company's most recent fundraising was the placement of 390 million shares in July, which netted approximately HK$763 million after expenses.In June, the company borrowed US$60 million in a term loan from a banking syndicate led by Hang Seng Bank Ltd..The company said these funds were to be invested in infrastructure projects and for general working capital.  In March, Harvest Sun, a consortium in which the group holds a 10 percent stake, raised HK$5.57 billion in a syndicated loan to fund the first phase of the Tai Kok Tsui station development.Following this investment and the capital raising efforts, the company's gearing ratio stood at about 25 percent to 30 percent of total assets, Kwok said.More funding will be required for the second phase of the project.Another similarly structured consortium won the tender to handle the second phase of construction of the Tai Kok Tsui station development in early August.Sino Land, the lead manager of this group, has the responsibility for arranging the financing for this project, roughly estimated to require HK$15 billion, said Kwok.Sino Land will hold 40 percent of this second project, Kerry 30 percent, Bank of China Group Investment 20 percent and China Overseas 10 percent.China Overseas' share of the total development cost will again be 10 percent of whatever financing is arranged.  The red chip property and construction company, which was listed in August 1992 on the back of the great upswing in the Hong Kong and China property markets, has been a play on the Hong Kong property market.The company is actively seeking absolute growth in both its China and Hong Kong operations, said Kwok.The company is a subsidiary of China State Construction and Engineering Corp, the largest state-owned construction conglomerate. It is directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Construction.Possibly the only worrying element in the company's background is the need for China Overseas to follow its parent's and Beijing's macroeconomic dictates, stock analysts said.In 1996, the emphasis is on cash-rich state enterprises acquiring and rejuvenating failing or bankrupt state enterprises, profitable coastal operations bolstering weak businesses in the hinterland.China Overseas seeks to rise to the task.Company chairman Sun Wen-jie, speaking at the company's annual general meeting in June, said the company was negotiating with some mainland parties to acquire several manufacturing projects including a cement manufacturing plant.", "label": ["C171", "C17", "C181", "C18", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "The economy boomed ahead more robustly than previously thought during the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday, growing at its fastest rate in two years.The nation's gross domestic product expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from April through June instead of 4.2 percent as estimated a month ago.The surprisingly strong surge in economic growth during the spring was likely to fuel doubts that a predicted second-half slowdown will occur soon enough to deter the Federal Reserve from hiking interest rates later this year.  (May be bylined Glenn Somerville)The second-quarter GDP growth was more than double the 2 percent rate of expansion recorded in the first quarter this year. It was the strongest for any three months since the second quarter of 1994, when GDP grew at a 4.9 percent annual rate.GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced by workers and capital within U.S. borders.Wall Street economists had forecast no change in the previously estimated 4.2 percent rate of second-quarter GDP growth rather than a big upward revision.The department said several factors accounted for the stronger growth, including a smaller drag on the economy from huge trade imbalances with the rest of the world because imports were not as strong as originally thought.Imports increased at a 9.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter rather than a 12.9 percent rate as estimated a month ago.In addition, investment in producers' durable equipment grew at a 6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, nearly double the previously estimated 3.2 percent gain.There also was more investment in expanding plants and adding new production equipment than the government had previously estimated and stronger spending by the government itself on goods and services.Inventories were leaner heading into the second half than originally thought. The department said businesses added to their stocks of unsold goods at a $7.2 billion annual rate between April and June instead of a $10.3 billion rate as it thought a month ago.The combination of increased business investment and smaller inventories suggests more room for companies to boost their output in the second half.A possible restraint is that consumer spending in the second quarter was not as strong as first estimated. Personal consumption spending grew at a 3.4 percent annual rate rather than a 3.7 percent rate, the department said.Strong job growth and income gains this year have generally buoyed consumer demand. So far there is little indication of sharp slowing in the overall economy during the third quarter as sales of existing homes eased only slightly in July and consumer confidence hit a six-year high in August.Despite strong growth in the spring, there was little sign in either of the two inflation measures in the GDP report that prices were heating up. The implicit price deflator advanced at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter -- the same as estimated a month ago -- down from a 2.2 percent increase in the first quarter.The fixed-weights measure of price changes rose at a 2.2 percent rate instead of 2.1 percent, still down from the first quarter's 2.3 percent rate of increase.", "label": ["E11", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG on Monday blamed a 37 percent slump in its first-half profit mainly on price slashing by European rivals but said its full-year earnings should be stable.The carrier posted pre-tax profit of 119 million marks for the first six months of 1996, sharply below the year-ago period's 189 million although slightly better than an estimate in July that profits would drop to 100 million marks.Its shares dropped 1.5 percent to 208 marks on the news.Disappointing growth in passenger and freight volumes limited expansion and the airline said its German business was hit by a flood of cheap flights from subsidised airlines, excess capacity and a fatal fire in April at Duesseldorf airport.To compensate, it pledged to cut its spending budget for the rest of the year by 190 million marks, or three percent, as well as removing five aircraft from service and trimming staff accordingly.\"As a result of these measures, the management board expects to be able to achieve earnings for the full year of 1996 which are comparable with year-ago levels, given stable currencies and a sales rise of five percent,\" Lufthansa said.Its pre-tax profit from ordinary activities rose to 756.4 million marks in 1995.Sales in the first half of this year climbed 6.6 percent to 9.8 billion marks despite lower turnover at Lufthansa Cargo. Lufthansa AG, Condor Flugdienst, Lufthansa CityLine and Lufthansa Technik all contributed to the advance.A Lufthansa spokesman said the German carrier's main price rival in the first half was Air France, which launched a strong assault on the lower end of the market.\"There were Air France price cuts of up to 30 percent,\" he said, noting that the rivalry with the French carrier extended to non-European flights as well as French-German routes.Lufthansa has repeatedly criticised rival airlines for using state subsidies to fund what it sees as unrealistic prices.However, it distanced itself from an aggressive attempt by one of its sales teams to redress the balance in Lufthansa's favour, reported in the German press on Monday.The carrier's North Bavarian sales team had sent letters to around 20 travel agents encouraging them to keep the British Airways share of the German market below 15 percent from mid-October through mid-December this year or risk getting worse terms of business from Lufthansa.Lufthansa said the incident was unauthorised and that there would be \"consequences\" for the department involved.The airline said passenger numbers virtually stalled at 19.7 million in the first six months of 1996. Freight and mail volume grew by 2.8 percent to 808,600 tonnes.The Duesseldorf fire, which closed the airport for several days, caused Lufthansa to lose at least a high two-digit million mark figure in revenue, the spokesman said.Lufthansa said it would give top priority this year to its cost-cutting programme, which aims to reduce unit costs by around 20 percent by 2001 in a bid to compensate for high German wage costs and the strong mark.As well as cutting spending, the airline said it planned to take three planes from its short-range and medium-range fleet and two from its long-distance fleet. The planes are likely to be sold, the spokesman said.", "label": ["C151", "C15", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

We are waiting for the approvals of certain authorities in certain countries,\" said Gebhard in an interview.Callebaut said on July 9 it planned to acquire French cocoa processor Cacao Barry from its leading shareholder, French holding company Societe Centrale d'Investissements (SCI), for an undisclosed price.Callebaut is a unit of Swiss diversified company Klaus J. Jacobs, owned by Swiss financier Klaus Jacobs.The merger would give the new firm control over an estimated 12 to 13 percent of the world cocoa bean crop.The new group also will be a major force in the world market for semi-finished and industrial chocolate products.Gebhard said cartel authorities in individual countries could ask for an extension, but Callebaut expected to have the answers from at least most of the cartel authorities on the merger around September 9.Analysts say that the new firm will have a significant share of some markets, notably Belgium.Gebhard declined to discuss particulars of various markets, citing the impending cartel decisions. But he did note that the company would have less of the various regional markets if manufactured chocolate is taken into account.\"It is all a matter of definition of the market,\" he said.He said that an initial public offering (IPO) planned for the new company was still under consideration for sometime next year, providing the merger is approved.He said the main listing was likely to be in Switzerland, but there was also expected to be an international tranche for such an offering, with listings possible in France and Belgium.Jacobs would be expected to remain the controlling shareholder in the new merged firm.But the IPO would be large enough to ensure enough liquidity in the shares, Gebhard said. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340", "label": ["C181", "C18", "C34", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

This time last year the discount was about $2.50.European markets are currently tight and high crude prices have supported outright prices.In addition, the 220,000 barrels per day (bpd) Nerefco Pernis refinery in Rotterdam goes into maintenance for 14 days in September and Portugal's EdP has tendered to buy up to 200,000 tonnes for delivery in September and October.Last week EdP's tender for an August cargo played a pivotal role in pushing prices higher.But bearish pressures were now expected to kick in.Traders looking to buy for the EdP tender may try and knock fuel lower before pushing the sector higher -- buying low from the market, then selling high into EdP.The Esso flexi coker in Rotterdam, which converts residual fuel to petroleum coke, may be down in September, resulting in more fuel than anticipated becoming available.Longer term, Northern Ireland's Premier Power, a large buyer of fuel oil which accounts for 850,000-1.2 million tonnes a year out of a total 2.5 million tonnes in the U.K, will progressively be reducing purchases in favour of natural gas from October, and will have stopped buying totally by January 1997.The withdrawal of such a key buyer is bound to be bearish -- the utility was partially responsible for August's tightness, buying 100,000 tonnes compared with previous August requirements of 45-50,000 tonnes to compensate for an inoperative coal unit at Kilroot.In the longer term, the severity of the winter will play a large role.

The weapons were being collected to give them up to the Russians.\"The Chechen side apologised officially to the Russian side and expressed the hope that provocations will not become a reason for the negotiations to be suspended,\" Udugov said.He said the Russians had told them they expected a report from the commander of the troops whose weapons had been stolen that they had got them back. \"As soon as they get the report, the negotiations will be continued,\" Udugov said.Interfax said earlier that the incident violated the agreement reached on Thursday to end military activities in Chechnya.\"If the separatist leadership does not fulfil the demands for the return of the seized weapons by the end of the day, it could seriously complicate Security Council Secretary A. Lebed's mission to find peaceful resolution of the Chechen conflict,\" it quoted a representative of the federal forces as saying.The meeting between Lebed and Maskhadov was due to have begun at 10 a.m. (0600 GMT).

It did not give any figures.Traders said officials agreed to cut by about 10 percent the values set on carpets being exported, lowering the amount of hard currency that has to be repatriated by exporters.Carpet exports fell to $968 million in the Iranian year that ended on March 19 from $1.6 billion the previous year after Iran in May 1995 adopted rules requiring exporters to repatriate their hard currency income and exchange it at the official rate.Traders had complained that exports were hampered by customs officials setting unrealistically high values on rugs. They said this forced them to export lower quality rugs, which damaged the prestige of Persian carpets abroad.Traders and newspapers had expressed concern over the fall in the exports and urged measures to support the carpet weaving industry, which employs about two million people.Officials said before the foreign exchange rules were imposed that only a third of the hard cash from Iran's annual non-oil exports of about $4 billion was being returned to the country through legal channels. The rest was going mostly toward smuggling luxury goods, they said.The rules, which set an official exchange rate of 3,000 rials to the dollar, were adopted to support the Iranian currency after it fell to as low as 7,000 to the dollar on the black market following the announcement of sanctions against Iran by the United States.", "label": ["E51", "E512", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The Czech Finance Ministry will soon issue a decree dividing revenues between the main power producer CEZ a.s. and regional distributors, the Industry and Trade ministry said on Friday.Minister Vladimir Dlouhy told a news conference the ruling, which will be based on an analysis done by an independent industry consultant, should be issued in early October.A row over the revenue split cut into the first half profits of CEZ, which only charges the regional utilities provisional payments this year because it has not been able to reach any agreements on the final price.CEZ, which says distributors do not make the advanced payments on time, has completed long-term supply deals, including prices, with only two of the country's eight regional utilities.\"We are advancing quite well here, and I believe that we will have the prices onn the paper at the beginning of October,\" said Dlouhy.\"The prices will be done for this year, ... but if we agree that this is the regular method of assessing the costs and the all possible division of the revenue cake, it is a method that should become the standard frame for every year,\" he added.Dlouhy said his ministry, CEZ, and the distributors were cooperating on the analysis with consultancy, which he declined to name.The average price CEZ charged the distributors last year was 1,033 crowns per megawatthour, which declined in the first half of this year due to the provisional payments of 1,020 crowns.The company said that this was the main reason why its half year net profit fell 4.9 percent to 5.95 billion crowns, according to international accounting standards.-- Jan Lopatka, Prague Newsroom, 42-02-2423-0003", "label": ["C11", "C13", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Archaeologists may be closing in on the final piece of proof needed to authenticate the first fort built as a permanent English settlement at Jamestown, the group that owns the property said on Wednesday.For two years, archaeologists have been digging at a patch of ground along the James River trying to follow what appears to be the remains of a wooden palisade, according to the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA).Centimetre after centimetre of soil has been sifted, yielding 90,000 artifacts, many of them dating to 1601 and indicating researchers were on the right trail, APVA spokesman Tim Kolly said.Jamestown was the first permanent English settlement in North America and slavery was also instituted there.The discovery of a bastion, or corner, that would enable archaeologists to trace the outline of the entire fort would clinch the discovery, Kolly said.\"We hope we'll find something in the next few weeks to prove that the fort has been located,\" added William Kelso, project director. \"We've just accumulated little bits of the puzzle.\"Still, the organisation was confident enough of the find to plan a September 12 announcement by Virginia Governor George Allen.Dennis Blanton, co-director of the Centre for Archaeological Research at the College of William and Mary, said a finding that the remains of a wooden palisade wall along the riverbank was the remnant of the 1607 fort first built by Captain John Smith and the earliest New World settlers from Europe would mark a milestone in American archaeology.\"If they have it, it's a world-class discovery,\" he said. \"It deserves any attention it gets. But 'if' is the key word.\"Since the dig started archaeologists have eagerly shared their progress, exhibiting crucial pieces such as copper coins stamped \"1601\" and other artifacts.For years, most archaeologists thought the last traces of the fort had been swept away by erosion along the James River.Bly Straube, curator of the Jamestown Rediscovery project, said the dig site continues to yield items of interest, but no definitive artifact has been unearthed.\"I'd like to say we've found something to say 'John Smith was here,' but we don't have it,\" Straube said.", "label": ["GCAT", "GENT", "GSCI"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

In the aftermath of this week's budget and the revised outlook on Australia to positive by Standard & Poor's, economists were asked for their forecasts for the 10-year bond yield, the 10-year yield spread to the U.S., and the Australian dollar versus the U.S. at end-December.Economists generally expect bond yields to retrace their steps slightly by year-end, but primarily on the back of a weakening U.S. Treasury market, which is seen facing tighter monetary policy amid a rebounding economy.However, Australia's positive outlook on inflation, international confidence in the the country post-budget and S&P's revised outlook, and the prospect of a further cut in official interest rates should see the local market's outperformance against the U.S. continue and see the yield spread compress further.The 10-year bond yield touched its lowest level since March 1994 on Wednesday at just below 7.80 percent following the budget and S&P's report, while the spread currently stands at around 125 basis points, its lowest level in over two years and half the level seen last April.Meanwhile, the Australian dollar will be underpinned by a global economic rebound, stronger commodity prices and through demand for Australian debt for the reasons above.However, the possibility of another rate cut and a further erosion of the yield diffential, particularly if the U.S. does tighten, could weigh on the currency.The AUD was trading just over US$79 cents on Friday.\t\t    Net Foreign   Balance of   Retail   Building\t\t     Debt Q2\tPayments     Trade    Approvals\t\t     (A$bln)\t (A$bln)     (pct)\t(pct)ABN Amro\t     n/f\t    1.2\t  +0.5\t  n/fAMP\t\t   184.00\t  1.6\t  +0.5\t +3.0Access\t\t187.5\t   n/a\t   n/a\t  n/aANZ Banking\t  n/f\t    1.1\t  -0.3\t +8.0ANZ Securities    184.0\t   1.45\t -0.5\t +5.0Bain\t\t  186.0\t   1.4\t  flat\t +2.0BT Australia\t185.9\t   1.2\t  +0.5\t +6.0BZW Australia     185.6\t   1.6\t  +0.1\t +2.3Citibank\t    182-186     1.2-1.6   flat-+0.4     +3-6Commonwealth\t186.0\t   1.4\t  +0.5\t +5.0County Natwest    187.0\t   1.5\t  +0.4\t +2.0CS 1st Boston     185.0\t   1.2\t  +1.0\t +3.5Dresdner\t    187.0\t   1.4\t  -0.25\tflatGIO Australia     184.2\t   1.2\t  +0.4\t+10.0HongKong\t     n/f\t    1.3\t  +0.2\t +4.5JB Were\t     185.5\t   1.1\t  flat\t +3.0JP Morgan\t    n/f\t    1.15\t +0.3\t +7.0Macquarie\t   188.0\t   1.3\t  +0.4\t +2.0McIntosh\t    187.5\t   1.4\t  flat\t +5.0Merrills\t    186.0\t   1.3\t  +0.3\t +5.0NAB\t\t   187.8\t   1.5\t  +0.5\t -2.0Nomura\t\tn/a\t     1.3\t  flat\t n/aPru Bache\t   182.00\t  1.2\t  +0.4\t +3.5Rothschild\t  178.00\t  1.2\t  +0.5\t +6.0SBC Warburg\t 187.00\t  1.4\t  +0.5\t +6.0State Bank\t  184.5\t   1.35\t +0.3\t +4.5UBS\t\t   186.00\t  1.35\t +0.8\t +3.0Westpac\t     185.00\t  1.40\t flat\t +5.0---------------------------------------------------------------    Low\t     178.00\t  1.1\t  -0.5\t -2.0    High\t    188.00\t  1.6\t  +1.0\t+10.0    Average\t 185.40\t  1.3\t  +0.3\t +4.0    Median\t  185.90\t  1.3\t  +0.4\t +4.0----------------------------------------------------------------BY END 1996\t     10-yr\t  AU/US\t   A$\t\t\t    yields\t Spread     (US cents)ABN Amro\t\t  7.50\t   120\t    79.00Access\t\t    8.00\t    90\t    79.10ANZ Banking\t     8.40\t   130\t    79.00ANZ Securities\t  8.00\t   110\t    79.00Bain\t\t\t7.60\t   100\t    80.00BT Australia\t   7.5-8.0\t 125\t    77.00BZW Australia\t   8.25\t   130-150\t78.50Citibank\t\t  7.50\t   100\t    80.00Commonwealth\t    8.20\t   140\t    79.00County Natwest\t  7.50\t   120\t    77.00CS 1st Boston\t   7.85\t   135\t    79.00Dresdner\t\t  7.80\t   150\t    80.00GIO Australia\t   n/f\t    n/f\t    80.00HongKong\t\t  8.0\t    140\t    79.50JB Were\t\t   8.2\t    100\t    77.00JP Morgan\t\t 8.8\t    150\t    77.00Macquarie\t\t 7.75\t 100/125\t  80.00McIntosh\t\t  8.0\t    130\t    76.00Merrills\t\t  8.0\t    100\t    77.00Nomura\t\t    7.60\t    90\t    78.00Pru Bache\t\t 7.75\t   120\t    80.00Rothschild\t\t7.25\t   125\t    76.00SBC Warburg\t     8.50\t    70\t    76.00State Bank\t\t7.90\t   140\t    78.00UBS\t\t\t 7.50\t   110\t    77.00Westpac\t\t   7.80\t   100\t    75.00---------------------------------------------------------------    Low\t\t   7.25\t    70\t    75.00    High\t\t  8.80\t   150\t    80.00    Average\t     7.90\t   118\t    78.20    Median\t\t7.85\t   120\t    78.75----------------------------------------------------------------June Quarter stocks and net exports were largely reduced to irrelevance by the early release June quarter GDP data and few analysts bothered to forecast either.NET FOREIGN DEBTNet foreign debt is seen widening a little to around A$186 billion from A$184.8 in the March quarter as the monthly run of current account deficits are only partly compensated for by the appreciation of the A$ in the quarter -- that automatically reduces the nominal value of debt denominated in foreign currencies. The figure may reinforce some analysts suspicions that the level of debt may have finally plateaued in a A$180/185 bln range after more than doubling between 1986/87 and 1994/95.CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITThe July's current account deficit looks like being close to June's surprisingly low A$1.29 billion thanks to an already reported three percent fall in merchandise imports in July. However, the net income deficit is something of an unknown since the ABS will have the first details from the June qtr Survey of Foreign Investment. These more up-to-date figures could also prompt a revision of past net income defcits.RETAIL TRADERetail trade was seen recording a small gain in July in line with a flattening trend in recent months and only modest employment growth. Cuts in mortgage interest rates that month might have helped sentiment but borrowers' bills would not have reflected the easing for a month or so. Consumers might also have been intimidated by growing negative press speculation ahead of the August budget.BUILDING APPROVALSBuilding approvals should show a reasonable rise for July but only because June's 7.9 percent fall was far sharper than expected.

{"token": "British mobile telephone group Orange Plc on Tuesday reported a jump in first-half pre-tax losses to 125.2 million pounds ($193.6 million), almost half as much again as in the first half of 1995.But Orange, whose shares have fallen well below the level at which they were floated in March, said the losses were as forecast and blamed the continued weakness in its stock on misplaced pessimism about the British mobile telephone market.\"A lot of people do not understand this transition process in our market place,\" group managing director Hans Snook told Reuters in an interview, referring to fears that growth in new business was falling as the market became more mature.\"Our net growth has increased dramatically,\" he added, saying it was succeeding in all key areas which drive the business.Orange said its turnover more than doubled over the first half of the year to 256.5 million pounds from 100.0 million as it added a further 194,000 subscribers to take its total customer base to 573,000.Snook said the figure had since increased to more than 600,000, giving it 10 percent of a market led by Vodafone Group and British Telecom's 60 percent-held Cellnet.Shares in Orange gained four pence to 191 after the results, which compared with a loss of 88.8 million a year earlier.But the stock is still well short of the 205 pence level of its flotation, which valued the group at some 2.5 billion pounds and propelled it into the FTSE-100 index of leading British shares.Orange, whose major shareholder remains the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa Ltd group which, along with joint venture partner British Aerospace, brought it to market, is not expected to turn a profit or offer a dividend until 1998.But Orange points to its \"churn\" -- the percentage of cancelled subscriptions over a year -- which has now fallen to 17.6 percent, against the 25-30 percent levels experienced by other mobile players, as proof of the quality of its business.It was also proud that it had pushed its average revenue gained per subscriber up fractionally to 446 pounds per head at a time when most mobile networks around the world are seeing their revenues per customer eroded by price-competition.\"We are not trying to attract the impulse buyer or the emergency user, both of whom offer low revenues as subscribers,\" Snook told a news briefing later on.Analysts said the results, and particularly the churn and revenue per subscriber statistics, would go somewhere towards reassuring investors that Orange could deliver on its flotation promises and put a floor under the shares.\"I think we've hit bottom. A run up to 200 pence is perfectly feasible,\" James Ross, an analyst at brokerage ABN Amro Hoare Govett, said.But others said Orange, without an earnings or dividend history, was still vulnerable to the type of knock-on effect experienced earlier in the year when it was hit by weakness in U.S technology stocks.\"With new operators coming onto the U.S. (mobile) market, there could be a shake-out there, and U.S. investors tend to think that what holds for the U.S. market is true elsewhere,\" SGST analyst John Tysoe said.", "label": ["C151", "C15", "C31", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Separatist guerrillas bombed a government office on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica on Thursday despite fresh warnings of a crackdown by Paris, police said.In the latest of a series of attacks, a two kg (4.4 lb) bomb seriously damaged Agriculture Ministry offices in the centre of the island capital Ajaccio, police said.The blast, just 50 metres (yards) from a police station, followed by a day a warning of a new \"get-tough\" policy by Paris toward the separatists, who seek greater autonomy.Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre, under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups, told the daily La Corse in a statement he had given \"firm orders\" to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice.Judges on the island had accused Paris of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists which have now failed.The latest bombing, close on the heels of the new orders, appeared to emphasise police impotence, some officials and commentators said.\"No searches, no arrests, no police reinforcements visible on the island despite the ministry's promises,\" the daily France-Soir lamented.\"On the island, as at the Place Beauvau (the Interior Ministry's Paris address), people are well aware who is who and who is doing what. It is time to end this nightly farce,\" said the pro-government daily Le Figaro in an editorial.No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday's blast, the 22nd to strike the resort island since mid-August, when separatist guerrillas ended a shaky seven-month truce.Corsica has been racked by low-level separatist-inspired violence, principally directed against government targets, for two decades, but the pace of the bombings has picked up markedly since separatist guerrillas buried the truce.The daily Le Monde reported on Wednesday some separatist movements were considering taking their attacks to the French mainland on the principle that \"300 grammes of explosives on the continent have more impact than 300 kilos in Corsica\".The newspaper said separatists may take advantage of social unrest widely expected on the mainland in coming weeks over government austerity plans to stoke a popular backlash against the government.", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Annual earnings per share also dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents.Analysts had on average forecast a A$1.343 billion net profit before abnormals.But News said in its commentary after its results that a budgeted profit rise of at least 20 percent for the full 1996/97 year was very attainable. It said the current year had begun with great promise due to Independence Day, moderating paper prices and solid U.S. television advertising orders.  Analysts said sharply lower earnings from News' book publishing division and its U.S. magazines and inserts had been the main surprise elements in the results for 1995/96.Book publishing earnings fell to A$90 million in 1995/96 from A$182 million in 1994/95, while magazines and inserts earnings fell to A$324 million from A$356 million.News said revenue gains at the magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at TV Guide.  News said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its Harper-Collins publishing division more than offset healthy results from its U.S. operation.It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations and weak performances from the San Francisco unit of Harper Collins had not helped.Analysts said News' forecast of at least 20 percent profit growth in 1996/97 may understate the bullishness of the outlook.\"If they're saying at least 20 percent then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent,\" said one analyst.  Nomura analyst Eric Betts also said the 1995/96 result was lower than expected. \"But looking forward there's some positive factors,\" he said.Some analysts again pointed to News' cashflow as a possible area of concern, saying however that News continued to have a reasonably strong balance sheet that was well supported by MCI Communications Corp's option to invest up to A$2 billion in a stake in News.Cash provided by operating activity in 1995/96 slumped to A$872 million from A$1.123 billion in 1994/95, while investments surged to A$2.998 billion from A$1.182 billion.

{"token": "Newspaper magnate Conrad Black celebrated his 52nd birthday on Sunday in the unfamiliar role of white knight after galloping in last week to grant a reprieve to the Canadian press.One of Black's trusted managers, Sterling Newspapers chairman Michael Sifton, took over on Wednesday as chairman of the 79-year-old news service, which was endangered earlier this year when Southam Inc., its biggest-circulation member, threatened to pull out of the cooperative.Black's Hollinger Inc. bought control of Southam, Canada's best-respected newspaper chain, in May. Two months later Southam's chief executive, William Ardell, who wanted to revamp Southam's news service to compete with CP, quit.Despite Black's recent acquisition of the lion's share of the newspaper industry in his native Canada and the appointment of a close lieutenant to run CP, Hollinger disputes that it has an iron grip on Canada's press.\"This is not, absolutely not, a Hollinger ... coup,\" David Radler, Hollinger's president and chief operating officer, said of Sifton's appointment to head CP.Black, who turned 52 on Sunday, is the youngest of the current breed of global newspaper magnates. Like Rupert Murdoch, he is not often seen as a hero by the media.Black began with a C$500 ($365) investment in two tiny Canadian newspapers, and with a little help from a multimillion-dollar family inheritance, he parlayed that into the Hollinger empire, which now spans three continents.Southam is the newest addition to Black's media toy chest, which includes the Daily and Sunday Telegraph in London, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Jerusalem Post and a 25 percent stake in John Fairfax Holdings Inc., which publishes the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Financial Review.Black has candidly confessed his delight at the respect and deference granted newspaper proprietors and admitted he likes hobnobbing with the rich, famous and powerful. His long-standing love affair with newspapers does not extend to the journalists he employs, however.Before a government commission on mass media in 1969, Black dismissed reporters as \"ignorant, lazy, opinionated, intellectually dishonest and inadequately supervised\" and slammed what he called an abdication of responsibility by many editors, publishers and newspaper owners.There is no reason to think he has changed his mind since. After a strike at the Telegraph forced management to step successfully into the breach for 36 hours, Black said \"one of the greatest myths in the industry\" was that journalists were required to produce a newspaper.Black said he was virtually forced to buy out Southam to protect his investment. Irritated with a group of independent directors who he said thwarted all efforts to reverse Southam's losses, Black bumped his stake up to 41 percent from 19.5 percent by buying out Power Corp. of Canada.His move on Southam seems to be classic Black. He usually starts with a small shareholding, ups it to a controlling interest and eventually acquires the entire business.This is how Black won the Telegraph and, earlier, acquired Argus Corp., a company where his father had been an executive and one he had reportedly coveted since childhood.Black's managers and board representatives are fast replacing those who opposed him at Southam. Defections emptied Southam's executive suite last week. Black is now chairman and chief executive of Southam, and Radler is deputy chairman.The young Black was apparently riveted by the character of Napoleon, \"A Life in Progress,\" whom he describes in his autobiography as an accomplished \"aphorist, swashbuckler and self-mythologist.\" He might have been describing himself.Black's tough approach to business once led Bob Rae, the left-wing former premier of the province of Ontario, to describe him as \"a symbol of bloated capitalism at its worst.\"Even his friends admit he tends toward narcissism. \"I think you have to have a certain arrogance to aspire to this sort of thing ... and to push it through. I don't think you do that with the humility which Jesus has commanded on us -- He said the meek will inherit the earth, not own the earth,\" Stephen Jarislowsky, a friend and business associate who sits on many Hollinger company boards, said in a recent interview.Black \"fell profoundly in love\" with London Sunday Times political columnist Barbara Amiel and married her in 1992.Amiel, vice president of editorial at Hollinger, is a sought-after party guest in London, and British society magazines Harper's and Queen and Tatler have both named her one of history's most alluring women.", "label": ["C181", "C18", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Iraqi and United Nations arms officials held more closed-door meetings on Tuesday but it was not clear whether progress was made on outstanding differences, U.N. and Iraqi sources said.U.N. senior arms envoy Rolf Ekeus arrived in Baghdad on Monday for talks on the controversial issue of U.N. occess to inspect Iraqi sites and on banned materials his inspectors suspect Iraq is still hiding.Days before Ekeus's arrival, the U.N. Security Council demanded Iraq stop blocking searches by his inspectors for concealed weapons. Iraq did not hide its anger at the accusations.The government newspaper al-Jumhouriya said on Tuesday the council's request was unnecessary and accused Ekeus, who chairs the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), of politicising his mission in Iraq.\"He has immersed himself in a political ploy against Iraq, masterminded by America for known political reasons,\" the paper said.It said Ekeus adopted \"practices and activities hostile to Iraq\", in reference to UNSCOM's persistent efforts to gain access to sites which Iraq deems vital to its national security.Ekeus was not available for comment. U.N. sources said the Iraqis, fearing for his safety  kept him under tight security.Jumhouriya ridiculed such security concerns which it said were being used by Ekeus and his commission as a means \"to incite the U.N. Security Council\" against Iraq.The two sides reached agreement last June on how to inspect facilities which Baghdad regards as symbols of its sovereignty. But the arrangements did not work out, as Iraq balked at several attempts by UNSOM experts to enter such places.Iraq accuses Ekeus of exceeding the authority given to him under the 1991 Gulf War ceasefire terms, compelling Baghdad to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction.The ban on Iraqi oil exports, except for the limited sales allowed under a deal Baghdad signed with U.N. last June, will not be lifted until Ekeus certifies that Iraq has fully complied with Gulf War weapons demands.Ekeus, in remarks made last week, said Baghdad had not yet met its disarmament obligations and charged that the Iraqis were obstructing missions by his inspectors.Jumhouriya described his remarks as \"poisonous...meant only to prolong the unfair sanctions on Iraq.\"UNSCOM says it still believes Iraq hides about a dozen of its long-range ballistic missiles and has not yet provided it with all documents and probably materials concerning its past weapons programmes.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Ali Shah after signing the loan agreement.The project was opposed by local environmental groups and non-governmental organisations, which questioned its social impact, cost and affordability.Last year, the World Bank dropped plans to lend $175 million from its concessional arm, the International Development Association (IDA), to build a 201-megawatt hydroelectric project in the Arun valley in east Nepal.The World Bank had doubts about the Himalayan kingdom's ability to implement the $764 million Arun III project.Instead, the World Bank asked Nepal to implement small and medium-sized projects and offered help to set up power development funds to finance these plants.Industrialists say the shortage of power has hampered industrial growth and efforts to entice foreign investment.", "label": ["C17", "C173", "C24", "CCAT", "E51", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

We don't know how many there could be,\" Gendarmerie Commander Johan Dewinne told reporters after police spent a fruitless day digging at a house owned by Marc Dutroux, the man at the centre of the inquiry.\"We are working on 13 dossiers on missing children from the past 10 years,\" Dewinne, head of Belgium's disaster investigation team and leading the hunt for corpses, said.Belgium was plunged into shock on August 17 as Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-old friends Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune in the garden of another house he owns. With them lay accomplice Bernard Weinstein, whom he admitted killing.Gendarmerie spokesman Major Jean-Marie Boudin said digging would resume on Thursday, and Dewinne said he hoped to wrap up excavations at the house in Jumet, a suburb of the southern city of Charleroi, by Friday evening.He said in all 11 sites would be systematically searched.As the scandal reverberated around the country, the lawyer of convicted child rapist Dutroux refused to defend him.\"I have a little girl of Julie and Melissa's age, who has been really disturbed by these events, and I don't think she could have understood that her father was defending this man,\" lawyer Didier de Quevy told Belgian radio.Dutroux and associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a makeshift dungeon in another of the six houses Dutroux owns in and around Charleroi.Dutroux has also confessed to kidnapping teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrechts who disappeared from the port of Ostend a year ago. Their fate remains unknown.Battling against heavy rain on Wednesday, investigators dug in several places in the yard of the Jumet house and are due on Thursday to begin investigating the rubble-filled basement.Britain's Superintendent John Bennett who supervised excavations in the Fred and Rosemary West \"House of Horrors\" murder case in England two years ago, was present on Wednesday.There were also fresh searches at other sites including the house in Sars-La-Buissiere where Melissa and Julie were hidden.Dutroux said the girls, who disappeared in June 1995, starved to death early this year, He denies killing them but admits paying accomplices 40,000 francs ($1,300) to kidnap them.They were buried in the eastern city of Liege on Thursday after what amounted to a state funeral amid outpourings of grief and anger.As the searches continued in Belgium, Dutroux was named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman. The Slovak office of Interpol said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one other Slovak woman.So far 10 people have been arrested in what has now become known as the \"Dutroux Affair\", including Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin who has been charged as an accomplice.Martin and Lelievre were interrogated again on Wednesday.There has been widespread anger over revelations of police bungling, and the Justice Ministry has ordered an inquiry. A chief police detective has also been arrested on fraud charges, fuelling questions about a possible high-level cover-up.There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux, an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support, managed to own six houses.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Others relax in the reading room overlooking the Nile.\"I've been to cafes in the States and Holland, and the computing facilities in this place are definitely tops,\" said American Keith Brafford, who ran into the cybercafe while on holiday in Egypt.Three years ago the government, in association with the Foreign Relations Coordination Unit of the Supreme Council of Universities, put Egypt online and now estimates there are more than 200,000 Internet users among its 60 million people.Access via a leased line costs 15,000 to 20,000 pounds a year but users can surf the information superhighway for rates of around 1,000 pounds a year through a dial-up number.And unlike in other Middle East countries where governments restrict usage, anyone with a computer and an international phone line can access absolutely anything on the Internet -- a fact which has brought jitters to Egypt's conservative society.\"Security and morality on the Internet are worldwide issues for discussion. We cannot ban such a major information source just because misuse happens everywhere,\" said Dr Tarek Kamel of the state's Regional Information Technology and Software Engineering Centre (RITSEC).Although the state is promoting the Internet as its latest tool for economic, tourist and social development, the media has capitalised on its smuttier side.Stories of teenagers downloading pornography and paedophilia in other countries and tampering with files of the defence and justice ministries make the front page of Egypt's newspapers. Local technology advances are buried deep inside.\"What about the video and the satellite dish?\" Kaddah tells the Internet's opponents.\"We try hard to guide the young people towards constructive information resources at our cybercafes and we make them sign a code of ethics when they join us so that they are aware of what things are acceptable to our society and what things are not. Until now, we haven't had any problems,\" she added.Their buzzing cybercafes have prompted Internet Egypt, one of 14 firms selling Internet services in Egypt, to think of opening more sites in Cairo and nationwide. Other companies are also planning to jump on the bandwagon.But users tend to come from the upper to upper middle income bracket, a minority among Egypt's teeming population.

England last beat their opponents in a series in 1982.Wasim paid tribute to Mushtaq, praising him as \"the best spinner in the world\".\"Each individual really fought well today,\" he said. \"The boys have really made me proud.\"  The irrepressible Mushtaq was named man-of-the-match as well as Pakistan's man-of-the-series and England could claim that without him the margin would have been less pronounced.He took five for 57 as England spiralled to defeat at Lord's, losing their last nine wickets for 75, and repeated the trick on his return to London, taking six for 67 in an unbroken 30-over spell to delight any purist.England thought they had suffered enough against the leg- spin of Shane Warne, but Wasim claimed Mushtaq, who has now taken 45 wickets in his last six tests, was bowling even better than the Australian.\"He's getting better day by day...I think he's the best spinner in the world,\" said Wasim. \"He's got more variety than Shane Warne.\"Wasim suggested Pakistan's bowlers \"have done the boys really proud\" but there are few weak links in a team who have not always bonded so successfully.\"We have just proved that if we stick together we can beat any team in the world,\" he said.Even when England were 166 for two in early afternoon, the Pakistanis still refused to settle for the easy option of a draw with victory in the series already assured.Their last eight wickets went down for 76 runs, the bubbling Mushtaq making the initial inroads before Waqar and Wasim Akram returned with the ageing ball.Despite losing Alec Stewart and Michael Atherton to bat-pad catches before lunch for 54 and 43 respectively, England must have felt they were out of serious bother as they moved within 30 runs of Pakistan with eight wickets in hand.But Thorpe edged a good ball to Wasim at slip, Hussain was adjudged lbw playing no shot having made 51 off 96 balls and Nick Knight offered a return catch with England still in arrears.At 187 for five, with a worn ball available for the Pakistan pace attack, it offered a real challenge for Chris Lewis, seeking to restore his reputation after being axed from his country's one-day squad for poor timekeeping.He battled it out with John Crawley for half an hour, only to fall lbw to the returning Waqar for four with England just 10 ahead.When Wasim persuaded John Crawley to glove a catch to silly point, the lead was still only 25 and the Pakistan captain roared back in after tea to dismiss Robert Croft and Alan Mullally in successive balls to spark a miniature pitch invasion.The Pakistani fans clearly thought it was all over and, after 6.4 overs, it duly was.", "label": ["GCAT", "GSPO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The bulldozer, which could not have entered through the city's gates, flattened the building which was intended as a centre for the handicapped.Palestinian lawmakers said the demolition was the latest sign of a tougher Israeli policy towards the city's 165,000 Arabs since the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won office in May.\"It is clear that the policy of the Likud government is to kill the peace process. The demolition of this building today is but an example of this policy,\" Palestinian Legislative Council member Ahmed al-Batsh said at the scene.Palestinian legislators Hanan Ashrawi and Ahmed Korei led a march of about 100 people from the demolition site.Korei, better known as Abu Alaa, said Palestinians wanted to know: \"if this is peace or a cover for continuing the occupation...This is peace by a bulldozer and by a tank.\"The demolition came a day after PLO officials said they had bowed to Netanyahu's demand to close their offices in Jerusalem. Netanyahu made the closure of the three offices a condition for resuming peace negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).Palestinians accuse Netanyahu of delaying the implementation of the self-rule accord with Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority in order to secure better terms on sensitive issues such the Jewish presence in Hebron and East Jerusalem.\"The building destroyed in the Old City was unoccupied. It was destroyed because it was built without a permit just as all buildings built without a permit are,\" a Municipality spokeswoman said.Israeli police said the building was funded by the Palestinian Authority for use as a social club.Hayel Sandouka, president of the al-Laqlaq Tower Centre, a charitable organisation helping Palestinians in the Old City, denied this. He said building was funded by private charities including organisations from Canada and Sweden.He said the the 150 square metre (1,600 square feet) building was part of a large project that would include a handicapped centre, a home for the elderly and a kindergarten.Palestinians said they feared the demolition was part of an attempt to seize a large plot of land owned by the charity.Palestinians say Israel is trying to settle Jews inside the predominantly Arab Old City to tighten its grip the area which contains sites holy to Jews, Moslems and Christians.Palestinians regard East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state.

This was so particularly for beef demand in Brazil, he added.Argentina already had good markets in Europe, Israel and South America, which were expected to grow, he said.\"It's difficult to be too prescriptive about it (the size of looming Argentine exports) at this stage,\" he said.Barnard is not alone in the Australian beef industry in casting a wary eye across the South Pacific toward Argentina.United Graziers Association president Larry Acton said on return from a visit to South America that Argentina, with a world class processing sector, had the potential to take a significant slice of Australia's grassfed beef export market and would chase the most lucrative of the world's markets, in Asiaand elsewhere.Australia and Argentina were competitors on world markets early this century but not in recent times.Argentina, Australia, the United States and the European Union are the world's biggest beef producers.The United States is turning increasingly to export markets and the EU, through subsidised beef, has been the world's leading exporter in some years in the 1990s.-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 373-1800", "label": ["C31", "C312", "CCAT", "E51", "E512", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "By Alan Elsner, Political CorrespondentDemocrats nominate President Bill Clinton for a second term on Wednesday, after heaping praise on him as a man of compassion who has created jobs, defended the weak, helped families and protected the environment.At the halfway point of the Democratic convention, polls are showing Clinton once again beginning to stretch his lead over Republican nominee Bob Dole.The lead was down to five points or less in some surveys immediately after the Republican convention of two weeks ago. But an ABC poll on Tuesday showed Clinton's advantage among registered voters back at 15 percentage points, a jump of five points between Sunday and Tuesday.That was without taking into account another day of barnstorming campaigning by Clinton as he rode a train across the American heartland on his way to Chicago, spilling new policy initiatives along the way.He will arrive in this lakeside city in time for the traditional roll call of states nominating him for a new four-year stint in the White House. The convention will also hear from Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday.The president's path has been prepared by dozens of speeches highlighting his record, none more passionate than First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton who lovingly recalled how her husband sat with her as she gave birth to their daughter Chelsea 16 years ago.It was a speech designed to dispel persistent character doubts about both Clintons, spawned by years of allegations about complex financial shenanigans in Arkansas, presidential womanizing and White House croneyism and misuse of power.Watched by her 16-year-old daughter, no longer the awkward, gangly kid with braces Americans met four years ago, Mrs Clinton made the case for Clinton as the loving husband of 21 years and advocate of family values.\"For Bill and me, there has been no experience more challenging, more rewarding and more humbling than raising our daughter,\" said Mrs Clinton.To safeguard the future of America's children, she said, \"It takes a president who believes not only in the potential of his own child but of all children, who believes not only in the strength of his own family but of the American family ...\"It takes Bill Clinton,\" she said to a thunderous ovation.Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo gave Clinton a seal of approval on behalf of the party's once dominant liberal wing, despite their deep disagreement with some of his centrist policies.Both said they objected to Clinton's decision to sign a Republican-inspired welfare reform bill than ended a 60-year-old guaranteed safety net for the poor. But still they urged the party to rally around the president.\"We disagree on a critical issue like welfare. But then if we elect him (Clinton) there is another day and a better day,\" Jackson said.Cuomo appeared as the defeated governor of New York, displaced by a Republican in the election debacle of 1994, that lost both Houses of Congress for the Democrats.Once seen as the Democrats' great hope, he clearly recognised that the party's future now belonged to Clinton and his more conservative politics. \"In the end, Bill Clinton spells hope and the Republicans spell disaster,\" he said.Indiana Governor Evan Bayh, a cautious technocrat, gave Democrats a glimpse of their possible future, delivering a measured keynote address that defended Clinton for signing the welfare legislation.\"President Clinton understands that welfare was intended to be temporary, make work possible,\" he said. \"And across America he has made that happen.Bayh's speech was a testament to the virtues of competence. It was virtuous, but dull and received nothing like the rapturous response evoked by Cuomo and Jackson.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "New York State, which was forced to rescue Utica from a potential default by buying some of its debt, on Thursday said it had wrung a promise from the troubled city to accept its oversight if its fails to repay the state.In the past, the cities of New York City, Troy and Yonkers have had to cede control of their finances or bonding to state-imposed control boards, a step Utica, which has a population of 68,000, has fought although it was teteering on the brink of a default.Saying cities throughout the state also faced problems as their tax bases were declining, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall also raised the possiblity of a state bond bank that would help cities when private buyers turn away.Utica had to sell new debt to repay about $25 million of bonds that mature on Friday. Had buyers failed to buy all of the $24.5 million of new debt it was issuing to pay off those bonds, the entire transaction would have fallen through.Once the state comptroller stepped in and bought $2.145 million of approximately $11.5 million of new notes, buyers who were interested in the rest of the issue but concerned about the city's shaky finances agreed to buy the rest.And McCall, who travelled to Utica, which is located about 95 miles away from Albany to announce that the city's debt sale had closed, did not paint over Utica's difficulties.\"Today is not a day for celebration. We've helped Utica avert default and bankruptcy, but we can't pat ourselves on the back for a job well-done, because the job isn't done yet,\" McCall said, in prepared remarks.In return for his assistance, the comptroller won several major concessions from the city, which restrict its ability to sell its waterworks. The concessions also protect holders of the new notes, as well as the state's Environmental Facillities Corp, which owns some of Utica's bonds.Utica, which sold $12.5 million of bonds in addition to the new notes, has about $53.5 million of debt outstanding. Its 1997 fiscal budget is about $37.5 million, and rating agencies say it faces a potential gap of about $2 million.To improve the security of the $11.5 million of new bonds it issued, Utica promised that it will not use its water revenues, which typically run at least $5 million a year, to back any more bonds until the state's notes are repaid.The $11.5 million issue comes due on May 22, and Utica was forced to pay a high yield of 8.25 percent on the short-term notes. Dennis Tompkins, a spokesman for the comptroller said only, \"We think it's a very good rate of return.\"The notes were bought by the state's investment pool.As part of the legal agreement for the notes, Utica also promised it would not sell, lease or encumber the water system until it has repaid the notes. It can, however, sign a contract to sell the system, and the comptroller noted that the city expects to sell its waterworks to the Upper Mohawk Regional Water Finance Authority.The Authority plans to issue bonds to finance this purchase, some of which will repay Utica's new notes.Utica agreed to pay one-ninth of the notes's interest each month, and not use the water revenues, which run at least $5 million a year, for any purpose other than to repay the notes or the bonds held by the Enviromental Facilities Corp.

Plans for an 800 million recapitalisation to restore reserve ratios would be finalised in the next few weeks.The property financing company, originally part of GAN's CIC banking arm, has been at the heart of GAN's financial woes for the past three years after falling prey to the crash of the property market in mid-1990.UIC's half year 1996 consolidated net loss was 711 million against a full year loss in 1995 of 1.58 billion francs.  UIC said its half year performance was hit \"by the weight of (property) provisions totalling 621 million francs\" and the real estate situation remained depressed. Property provisions for the full year 1995 totalled 1.07 billion francs.GAN has made repeated provisions for UIC, which in 1994 reported a full year loss of 3.08 billion francs. UIC has said it hopes for a return to breakeven in 1997.UIC reported a gross half year operating loss of 70 million francs. Net consolidated banking income was 175 million francs.

This fall included a one billion franc reduction in loans to real estate developers to 3.3 billion francs, which were provisioned at a rate of 64.5 percent.The UIC spokeswoman said no upturn was in sight to the real estate problems with the worst hit commercial property.\"Prices continue to fall regularly,\" she said.Office property represents one third of UIC's real estate holdings.GAN, a recipient of large state handouts to ready it for privatisation, hopes to achieve break even in 1996 and be in profit next year.To help accomplish this, it plans to sell 67 percent of CIC, which has a book net asset value of 14.1 billion francs. It hopes to complete the transaction in October or November.It had wanted to keep a majority stake in profitable CIC, but the government wanted it to sell more to generate cash to capitalise structures it created to manage UIC's loan portfolios.", "label": ["C151", "C15", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The amnesty benefited officers who committed human rights abuses during his rule.The ruling effectively ended the Soria family's hopes of prosecuting the case, a frequent point of friction between Chile and Spain, in Chilean courts. The ruling cannot be appealed.Soria, a Spanish diplomat who worked for the Santiago-based U.N. Economic Commission on Latin America (CEPAL), was found in a ravine with his backbone snapped. There were also indications he had been severely tortured.Two now-retired army officers, Jose Rios San Martin and Guillermo Salinas, were charged with kidnapping and torture in the case.Soria's family said the murder was not covered by the amnesty because he held diplomatic status, an argument rejected both by military and civilian courts.The family's arguments amounted to \"mere affirmations by witnesses, without any documented, official backing,\" said the court's ruling. It added that Soria's position at CEPAL was not high enough to give him the benefits of diplomatic status.Evidence presented in the case showed that Soria was abducted by agents of Pinochet's feared secret police, the DINA, on June 14, 1976, and was later tortured to death.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The hryvna replaces the temporary karbovanets coupon, to be withdrawn on September 16.Yushchenko said price rises for electricity and gas, which started on August 1, would take inflation this month to 5-6 percent.But he said increased demand for cash and stockpiling of goods in advance of the currency swap could add another four percentage points to inflation.In June and July Ukraine achieved record low monthly inflation rates of 0.1 percent.The highest rate so far this year was 9.4 percent in January and Ukraine hopes to achieve an annual rate of about 40 percent, agreed with the International Monetary Fund.The IMF has been pushing Kiev to eliminate consumer subsidies for energy, which is why electricity and gas prices have been raised.Yushchenko said the central bank would review its interest rates after September 7, when it has had a chance to monitor the launch of the hryvna.The central bank has cut its refinancing rate steadily this year as inflation has slowed.

{"token": "Malaysian palm oil prices, now trading at three-month highs, are expected to climb further in the near term on the back of strong export demand, traders said on Wednesday.They said a recent pick-up in the export business had also helped dispel earlier concerns that domestic palm oil stocks would reach one million tonnes this year.Also, the seasonal increase in output has been at a slower pace than expected due largely to sharply lower production in the states of Sabah and Sarawak on Borneo island.\"Stocks are not building up as fast as the market had expected. And with exports likely to remain healthy in the next few months, the market has greater upside than downside potential,\" said one trader.Malaysia's benchmark third position crude palm oil futures closed on Tuesday at 1,232 ringgit ($494) a tonne, up from 1,142 ringgit two weeks ago.Traders said exports to India, a major export market in recent months, are expected to remain good in coming months.Industry officials in India have said the country might import up to 250,000 tonnes of palm olein during the Hindu festival months of September and October to offset thin domestic supplies.Most of the oil is likely to come from Malaysia as Indonesia, another leading exporter, is facing tight domestic supply, Malaysian traders said. In fact, Indonesia was said to have bought Malaysian palm olein in recent days.On Tuesday, India's State Trading Corporation bought 12,000 tonnes of Malaysian palm olein for September/October shipment. Pakistan bought 6,000 tonnes RBD palm oil and 3,000 tonnes of palm olein for October 10 delivery.Traders said India would continue to buy even at current prices as domestic oils are not available in bulk quantities ahead of the festival season.India imported nearly 220,000 tonnes of palm olein between April and July, the industry officials said.Traders said China may also make a return to the market after the government recently approved imports of 1.3 million tonnes of palm oil between August 1996 and March 1997.While the news may have been factored into the market, they said China's incremental purchase of palm oil under the quota will help support prices.Traders added that though rising prices could lead to some washout of existing contracts, the impact on prices would be minimal. Indian and Chinese buyers were said to have washed out some 35,000 tonnes of palm oil on Tuesday.\"Washing out of contracts is possible as buyers take advantage of higher prices but I don't think it will have any significant impact,\" one trader said.Private crop forecaster Ivan Wong said in a recent report that Malaysian palm oil stocks would not reach worrisome levels as long as palm oil prices remain competitive in relation to other major oils and fats. He also expects the healthy exports to be sustainable up to October.Stocks at the end of July stood at 754,634 tonnes, according to official Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority estimates. Exports in July were 646,017 tonnes, the second highest monthly figure ever recorded.Cargo surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance on Monday estimated Malaysia's palm oil exports for August 1-25 at 537,175 tonnes against 521,904 tonnes for July 1-25.

Huntsman Corp is not interested in pursuing further negotiations nor in commencing an unsolicted tender offer at this time.

{"token": "By Gail Appleson, Law CorrespondentThe tobacco industry's troubles deepened Wednesday with the White House expected to endorse strict new regulations on cigarettes on Friday and jury deliberations about to start in a key smoking case.The timing of the White House announcement could hardly be worse for the industry, which is still reeling from a surprise $750,000 damage award earlier this month.Meanwhile, Michigan became the 13th state to sue the industry Wednesday, and on Thursday an Indiana jury is to start weighing whether cigarette makers can be held liable for a smoker's addiction that allegedly led to his death.Tobacco stocks were already tumbling Wednesday on concerns about the Indiana trial when White House officials said they expected President Bill Clinton to accept the new regulations from the Food and Drug Administration on Friday.The rules were expected to be similar to those the FDA proposed about a year ago. Those included barring cigarette billboard advertising near schools and playgrounds and eliminating mail-order sales, vending machines, free samples, self-service displays and sales of fewer than 20 cigarettes.The tobacco industry has sued, challenging the FDA's legal authority to regulate tobacco.Closing arguments were set to begin Thursday morning at the Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis.The jury, which is expected to start deliberations in the afternoon, will be the first panel to decide a smoker's wrongful death case since the surprise verdict by a jury in Jacksonville, Fla., on Aug. 9.If the industry loses the case it will strengthen the view among plaintiffs' lawyers and jury consultants that jurors' attitudes are changing and that panellists are more willing to hold cigarette companies liable for a smoker's addiction.\"If the plaintiffs win (the Indiapolis case) the tobacco companies are really in the soup,\" said Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor who chairs the Tobacco Products Liability Project in Boston.The stock of Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the world's largest cigarette maker, tumbled $3.875 to $87.625 on the New York Stock Exchange and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., the owner of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, fell $1.375 to $25.25.Other tobacco company stocks also fell, and the drop helped pull the entire stock market lower, analysts said.Although the uncertainty from the trial was hurting stocks, the Indianapolis jury, unlike the Florida panel, was not shown certain inflammatory internal tobacco documents.Jury consultants said the documents, which concern the tobacco industry's knowledge of nicotine and addiction, angered the Florida jury. The papers convinced panellists that tobacco companies try to keep smokers hooked and that smoking was not a matter of individual choice, consultants said.The tobacco industry maintains that nicotine is not addictive and denies that it manipulates the level of nicotine to keep smokers hooked.Personal injury lawyers have not been overly optimistic about the Indianapolis case because the documents were not allowed in as evidence. The case involves Richard Rogers, an Indianapolis lawyer who died of lung cancer in 1987. Rogers, who was 52 when he died, began smoking as a young child by stealing his father's cigarette butts.When the case first went to trial last year, the jury was split 5-1 on whether Rogers \"voluntarily\" incurred a known risk by smoking.\"Heads, we win and it becomes a smashing victory. Tails we lose and nobody thought we would win all of these cases,\" said Daynard of the Tobacco Products Liability Project.A loss in the jury case without admission of the key documents could have severe implications for an industry that is facing mounting legal attacks across the country.Since Monday, Kansas, Arizona and Michigan have joined 10 other states that have filed lawsuits aimed at forcing tobacco companies to pay for Medicaid costs of smokers. Oklahoma is expected to file a similar case on Thursday that will bring the number of states to 14 by the end of the week.New Jersey also plans to file a Medicaid suit in the near future and several other states including Hawaii, Utah and Arkansas are also seriously interested.There are also more than 200 cases brought on behalf of individuals in the state of Florida alone and a growing number of class actions including a second-hand smoking case involving flight attendants set to go to trial next year.", "label": ["C12", "C13", "C152", "C15", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Sweden's doubts about monetary union make the country's a quick entry into the EU exchange rate mechanism (ERM) unlikely even if neighbouring Finland decides to join this autumn, economists said on Thursday.\"There is no reason for Sweden to join the ERM until we have decided to enter monetary union,\" one analyst in Stockholm said.Speculation about imminent Swedish ERM entry seems to have cooled considerably over the last few months, despite signs that Helsinki may decide to join any month now.\"I think the reasonable conclusion is that it is being put on ice,\" said Thomas Pousette, head of economic research at Nordbanken.A statement by Finance Minister Erik Asbrink on Wednesday that Swedish entry into economic and monetary union (EMU) could be delayed beyond its planned start in 1999 has strengthened the view that the crown will continue to float on currency markets.\"It is clear that it is hard to reconcile ERM membership with this standpoint,\" said Swedbank economist Ake Gustafsson.Asbrink said it was an open question whether Sweden would join EMU in the first stage or not, further fuelling speculation that Sweden would decide next year not to join EMU in 1999.\"It is not a question of yes or no to currency union. It is rather about 'yes now' or 'no now',\" Asbrink said in a signed article in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper.His comments, which caused domestic bond yields to rise and the crown to weaken, came at a time when speculation is mounting that Finland will soon decide to link its currency to the ERM.Such a move would be in line with Helsinki's determination to be among the first group of countries to join EMU.\"It is completely clear that the markka will be linked,\" said Risto Uimonen, editorial writer at daily Helsingin Sanomat. \"All the time the question has been one of when, not whether.\"The main reason for joining ERM would be to qualify for the single currency since it seems to be one of the criteria laid down by the EU's Maastricht treaty for entering monetary union.Both the Swedish crown and the Finnish markka have been floating since Europe's currency turmoil in 1992.Economist James McKay at investment bank Paine Webber said that while Finland and Italy may join the ERM within the next few months, Swedish entry was unlikely both this year and next.Referring to a split about monetary union among the party's supporters, McKay said it was was becoming \"increasingly difficult for the Social Democratic government to further integrate the Swedish economy with Europe.\"However, economists saw only limited benefits from joining ERM, apart from helping in meeting the EMU criteria.They seemed to be happy with the current policy aimed at keeping inflation low, rather than fixing the currency.\"We know that (Swedish Prime Minister) Goran Persson views the system as not appropriate for the Swedish krona. I would certainly agree with him on that point,\" McKay said.He said the Swedish economy, relatively dependent on forestry products, was quite different from the one of core Europe. A link to the German mark could therefore \"promote quite significant volatility in the economy,\" he added.\"So I would not view a link as that appropriate for the time being and I suspect that is the line domestic politicians will be taking, particularly given the public opposition towards further integration,\" McKay said.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "G151", "G15", "G154", "G158", "GCAT", "M13", "M132", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

The two men are due to meet again at 3 p.m. (1100 GMT), Tass said.\"There will be no more obstacles to the continuation of our task,\" Tikhomirov said after talks on Tuesday in the village of Novye Atagi, 20 km (12 miles) south of Grozny.The deal, which provides for a truce and Russian withdrawal from Grozny and southern regions of Chechnya, had been delayed after a group of Chechens disarmed a Russian column on Saturday.But Tikhomirov said the seizure of the weapons would no longer block the deal.Russia has also been pulling soldiers out of southern Chechnya, mountainous regions which it never fully controlled throughout the conflict.Both sides have said the truce is broadly holding, although Russian news agencies said Moscow's troops came under fire half a dozen times overnight. Nobody was hurt.Hopes of a rapid political solution to the conflict faded after Yeltsin, on vacation in the Moscow region, declined to meet Lebed, his chief security adviser and his special representative in Chechnya.Interfax quoted Lebed's spokesman as saying documents outlining a \"comprehensive plan\" and an account of Lebed's weekend talks with separatist leaders had been passed to Yeltsin.\"Russian society is being forced to accept that there are no winners in the Chechen war,\" Pravda daily newspaper wrote on Wednesday.Lebed has disclosed no details of his plans to end the conflict which has already killed tens of thousands of people.But Russian media have said the decision on the most painful issue of the conflict -- whether Chechnya should become independent as the rebels want or remain part of Russia -- would be put off until the region recovers from the war.Yeltsin's delay in meeting Lebed has prompted speculation that the president, who sent troops to crush Chechnya's bid for secession in December 1994, could be too unwell to deal with the matter or that he was waiting to see if Lebed succeeded.", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Its yield jumped to the highest levels in almost four weeks to change hands at the psychological 7.0 percent barrier in late trading.  Analysts said the market's pessimism started to brew late on Friday after the Federal Reserve announced the outline of the discussion of the July 2-3 meeting of its policy-setting body, the Open Market Committee.The FOMC summary showed Federal Reserve officials shifted their directive towards a more restrictive monetary policy for the first time since March 1995.The Fed's decision was seen as another indication that an interest rate hike before the end of the year is still a plausible possibility.  \"I think it (the Fed's decision) caught a lot of investors off-guard,\" said Kevin Flanagan, first vice-president and money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\"We have not eliminated the prospects of a Fed tightening as many had thought,\" he added.The sell-off broke some key resistance levels, deteriorating the market's technical outlook and fueling further selling by small and medium investors.Analysts said the next challenge for long-term yields is now around 7.05 and 7.10 percent. But some said 30-year rates could rise to 7.25 percent over the next month.  \"I think the bears control the ball,\" said Michael Strauss, managing director and chief financial strategist at Chase Securities. \"I do expect higher rates going forward.\"A new batch of government securities, which will begin to hit the market as of Tuesday, also depressed Treasury prices. Players are seen wary of buying the securities as the outlook for the economy remains blurry.Pundits said the government's August employment report will be crucial to give the market direction and help the Federal Reserve define the future course of monetary policy at the September 24 meeting of its policy-setting arm.  \"There is a lot of nervousness awaiting the job market data ... So people are reluctant to buy and we also have the supply coming up,\" said David Sloan, senior economist at consulting firm I.D.E.A.

Residents were being charged around 40,000 dong ($3.60) a trip.As waters continued to rise, local authorities ordered access points on the centuries old main Hanoi dike sealed as an emergency measure to protect the city of 2.2 million people from widespread damage.The threat to Hanoi -- the worst since 1971 -- follows a series of devastating storms across northern Vietnam over the past 10 days.In provinces southeast of the capital, efforts were continuing to account for hundreds of missing people after a whirlwind storm tore through fishing fleets and coastal areas a week ago.In mountain provinces in Vietnam's remote northwest thousands of families were said to be without sufficient food supplies after flooding and landslides caused by torrential rains at the weekend.Vietnam's Red Cross issued figures on Wednesday saying 153 people had been killed, 293 were missing and nearly seventy thousand families had been affected across the north over the past week.The figures differed from those given in a newspaper interview a day earlier by Agriculture Minister Nguyen Cong Tan, who said 635 people were still unaccounted for.While an accurate casualty toll may not be known for some time, it is already clear the damage to northern Vietnam -- one of the poorest areas of the country -- is some of the worst in years.According to preliminary estimates, more than 105,000 hectares (259,457 acres) of rice fields have been flooded.

A spokesman did not give the reason for his visit.Nyerere's staff in Dar-Es-Salaam said he would attend \"an international forum\".

There are no secret behind-the-scenes attempts to broker any deals,\" he said, adding that Buyoya's government however remained willing to talk to the Hutu rebels as long as they renounced genocide and laid down their arms. They have refused to do so.Rebel leader Leonard Nyangoma, head of the Hutu National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), visited Rome earlier this month and had contacts with Sant' Egidio.CNDD officials in the Kenyan capital Nairobi said despite rumours of imminent contacts with Buyoya's regime, their movement would refuse to meet any Burundi envoys and had vowed to topple Buyoya.Regional states imposed sanctions against Burundi following the July 25 coup by the Tutsi-dominated army.Sanctions have hit the landlocked country hard, forcing the rationing of petrol and diesel and dramatically increasing prices of imported food and goods. The fuel shortage has pushed up the cost of food grown in the interior.Regional states demand a return to constitutional government and unconditional talks between all parties including the army and rebels. Both sides reject unconditional negotiations.Ousted Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who says he is still legal head of state, has remained holed up in the U.S. ambassador's residence in Bujumbura for more than a month.Around 150,000 people -- mostly civilians -- have died in Burundi since 1993, when the country's first democratically elected Hutu president was killed in an attempted army coup.The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said last week 4,050 people had been killed by Burundi's army in the Giheta district of central Gitega region since the coup.Buyoya dismissed the report as exaggerated and said his coup was to bring peace to Burundi but it would not come overnight.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIP", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Several thousand Rwandan Hutu refugees were expected to leave a camp in Burundi and return to Rwanda on Monday, a U.N. official said.Paul Stromberg, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said up to 1,500 Rwandan refugees had boarded trucks at Rukuramigabo camp to return to Rwanda.\"There are a similar number waiting to board trucks. By the end of the day we could have at least 3,000 or more back in Rwanda,\" said Stromberg, adding before any had left on Monday the last Rwandan refugee camp in Burundi had 10,000 refugees.Stromberg said a total of 43 trucks and buses were involved in emptying Rukuramigabo camp and more might be on the way.An operation to empty the largest Rwandan camp in Burundi ended last Thursday when the last of 50,000 refugees crossed into Rwanda, leaving 223 who refused to go home voluntarily.The Hutu refugees leaving Burundi are part of more than two million who fled Rwanda in 1994 during civil war and in fear of reprisal attacks for the killing of up to one million Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs.Refugees began returning in large numbers after Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army seized power on July 25. They have accused troops of harassing them and three were killed by soldiers a week ago.Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said on Thursday Zaire and Rwanda agreed on an \"organised, massive and unconditional\" repatriation of 1.1 million Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire.He said the repatriation would be \"enormous and immediate\" and Zaire would close all Rwandan refugee camps on its soil.UNHCR was not consulted in advance about the Zairean-Rwandan agreement, which prompted a Rwandan Hutu refugee lobby group to warn expulsions of refugees from Zaire could start within days.Romano Urasa, UNHCR head in Rwanda, told Reuters on Monday his agency always aimed at an orderly refugee return from Zaire and UNHCR was taking the Rwandan-Zairean statement seriously.Urasa said UNHCR's transit centres on the Zairean border would have a maximum capacity of 43,000 to 45,000 returnees per night as long as the repatriation from Zaire was orderly.He said Zairean authorities were separating Rwandan Hutu intimidators, hardliners strongly opposed to any voluntary return to Rwanda, from refugees in camps in eastern Zaire.A Rwandan army spokesman said 28 Rwandan Hutus from camps near Goma, Zaire, and another 18 from camps around Bukavu expelled by Zaire last week would arrive in Rwanda's capital on Monday.They were expelled as camp troublemakers by Zaire and arrested on arrival in Rwanda. Many were former members of the former Hutu army, which was closely involved in the genocide.Urasa said circumstances surrounding the Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire were different from the previous two years as the country was facing presidential and parliamentary elections.He said two weeks ago tribal chiefs in Zaire's North Kivu province blamed their government for the presence of members of an exiled Rwandan Hutu extremist militia in their villages.\"The local population is less and less pleased with the presence of the refugees,\" said Urasa.He said UNHCR's operation caring for 1.1 million refugees in eastern Zaire was costing $1 million per day and was the largest and most difficult of any such undertaking in the world.Rwandan authorities screen returning refugees and arrest any suspected of involvement in genocide.

From that, you can deduce (it will be) rougly that sum,\" he said, responding to a question about the amount.Finance ministry sources have said a preliminary plan calls for the spending cuts to be taken evenly across all ministries in order to meet the balanced budget.  The major culprit in a more than six billion crown shortfall in projected 1996 revenue is apparently Russia, which has failed to pay roughly five billion crowns in credit owed to the Czech Republic this year.Another problem was the higher-than-expected expenditures on heating subsidies to households because of the unusually long and cold winter.-- Jan Lopatka, Prague Newsroom, 42-2-2423-0003", "label": ["E211", "E21", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

In fact we reject it completely because the obligations must be fulfilled in time,\" Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), secretary of the PLO's executive committee, told the London-based Arabic newspaper al-Hayat.An Israeli official quoted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday as telling a closed-door session of Israel's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee that there would be no progress until the offices were closed.Under a peace accord with the PLO, Israel was due to have redeployed its troops by the end of March in Hebron, the last major Arab West Bank city still under Israeli control.Israel delayed the redeployment in Hebron after Moslem militants killed 59 people in Israel in a spate of suicide bombings in February and March.Abu Mazen said the two sides had made preparations to revive the activities of a joint economic committee, including naming heads of the two delegations.\"There is hope to complete other circles.

{"token": "Dresden's Baroque Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) was set to host its first service since it was destroyed in a 1945 bombing raid with the inauguration of its restored crypt on Wednesday.Once the centrepiece of the Baroque centre that earned Dresden the name \"Florence on the Elbe\", the Frauenkirche was bombed on February 13, 1945, in a British and U.S. air assault that killed some 35,000 civilians. The church tower stood, a smoking shell, for days after the raid before collapsing.\"The inauguration (of the crypt) should spur efforts to complete reconstruction on the whole church,\" said the Bishop of Saxony, Volker Kress, who was due to lead the service attended by about 300 clerics, regional and city officials.Kress said he hoped the vaulted crypt, reconstructed from photographs, would inspire more donations. Restoration could cost a total of 250 million marks ($165 million) and take another 10 to 15 years.But only 25 million marks have been raised so far, he said in a recent interview.Guests at the ceremony included the premier of the regional state of Saxony, Kurt Biedenkopf, and other dignitaries who have supported the project, which got under way in 1993.Britain's \"Dresden Trust\" and a U.S.-based foundation are also helping raise money for the project.The inauguration marked the end of 50 years of debate over whether Dresden's famous Italianate church, which was completed in 1743, should be allowed to rise out of the ashes or be left as a permanent reminder of the futility of war.\"For Dresdeners the Frauenkirche will remain a symbol for peace and reconciliation,\" said Matthias Oelke, a spokesman for the church. \"Once again the Frauenkirche will be the spiritual centre of Dresden,\" he said.The ruins always had symbolic significance. They became a meeting place for the then-East German peace movement that arose in the 1980s to oppose the Communist regime.Protesters also gathered every year on February 13 to remember one of the most brutal air raids of the war and to demonstrate against the arms race. The tradition remained after German unification in 1990.Tens of thousands carrying candles come to the church every year to call for peace and to listen to church bells that chime the hour the first bombs fell at 9:45 p.m. Dresden, previously untouched by the allied bombing campaign, was bombed for several days, by American aircraft at night and British by day.", "label": ["GCAT", "GREL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "To someone known for either the rich classical film scores of 'Last Emperor' and 'Little Buddha' or his innovative work on the synthesiser, Ryuichi Sakamoto's latest incarnation has been a surprise, not least to himself.Dumping orchestra, synthesisers, sequencers and computers, the bleach-haired Sakamoto fronts a stripped-down trio of piano, violin and cello for a tour and album (\"1996\") that has brought him closer to his audience and also, he says, to himself.\"I was a bit afraid that this tour would be a little weaker than the other ones before because we are just three, and without hi-tech equipment, but actually the result is the other way round,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\"This time I have had the strongest reaction I have had in my life, because there is no wall between us so as we get the same vibe from the audience and they get the same thing from us. It's two-way communication.\"For the striking, softly spoken Sakamoto, whose score for Bernardo Bertolucci's \"Last Emperor\" won him an Oscar, a Grammy and a Golden Globe, this is unusual territory.Onstage with Everton Nelson (violin) and Jacques Morelembaum (cello) he weaves an atmosphere of intimacy despite the austere surroundings of Hong Kong's Concert Hall.The pieces range from arrangements of his haunting film scores -- \"Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence,\" \"Sheltering Sky\" and \"Last Emperor\" -- to Okinawan folk songs and the minimalism and experimentation of new material from \"1996\".During an improvisatory interlude, Sakamoto leaves his stool to pluck the strings of his grand piano and strikes its wooden sides, clearly enjoying himself alongside his fellow musicians.At other times he throws back his shock of yellow-black hair as he pounds the keys dramatically, or hunches during quieter moments, face disappearing under his fringe as he draws familiar but moving melodies from the upper reaches of the keyboard.For Sakamoto, 44, the collaboration may be a turning point.\"This tour has given me something more than I expected and this trio is becoming now more important than I expected, so I am thinking about using this trio in the future, maybe for the next album,\" he said.If he does it would mark an unusual continuity in Sakamoto's eclectic musical wanderings.A list of his collaborators reads like a Who's Who of great contemporary pop and jazz musicians, including David Byrne, David Sylvian, Youssou N'dour, David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He has also acted in two of the movies he wrote music for, as well as allowing his good looks to sell clothes for Barney's and Gap.But for the classically trained Sakamoto, his music remains a journey of discovery that has taken him through styles as diverse as Brazilian, Indonesian, techno and the rhythms and instrumentation of traditional North Africa.And, while he maintains contact with many of those he has worked with, sometimes playing alongside them later, he says this musical journey is a very personal, solitary one.\"I am seeking my own style...one I can say 'this is Sakamoto style, this is my style... So until then I have to try many things,\" he said.Does he feel he has reached that point?\"It's not perfect enough, no. It's maybe 80 percent. Because I have tried many things, and now I know this is good, this is bad, this is useful, this is not. But still there are many things I haven't done, so I would like to try more,\" he said.While this tour, which took in Europe, Asia, Australia, Japan and the United States, has highlighted his skills as a pianist, Sakamoto said there was little chance of him forsaking permanently the technical gadgetry of the modern keyboardist.\"I still love it. I am a fanatic of computer technology, the Internet, digital recording systems and so on,\" he says.Indeed, Sakamoto is true to his roots as an early dabbler in synthesiser technology, hooking himself up for this tour to the Internet to offer some of the first live concert broadcasts through the medium.So where does he see music, and in particular synthesiser music, going? Is melody, composition and originality in danger of disappearing under the weight of sampled music, monotonous pulse-driven dance music and recycled songs of yesteryear?Sakamoto, fresh from a concert in China, thinks not.\"When I was in Beijing I was coming into the city from the airport and I was looking outside the bus. There was blue sky, trees, flowers and birds; cars and highways too. But nature is always there and I was convinced the future of music won't be different,\" he said.\"I will still be moved listening to Mozart, when I get to 60 or 70; in 10 or 20 years' time it won't be different.\"", "label": ["GCAT", "GENT", "GPRO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

It's easy to underwrite retrospectively,\" Peter Spendlove, managing director of West of England Ship Owners Insurance Services Ltd, told a news conference at the launch of the club's annual report.On Monday the London club, one of 14 mutual marine insurance clubs making up the International Group, said it was looking for a substantial cut in the P&I clubs' annual $330 million reinsurance contract.Spendlove noted that, although claims had been below premiums paid in recent years -- making the P&I account very attractive to reinsurers -- this had not always been the case.\"I remember very well when we were negotiating the renewal of the group policy for 1992/93, it was hard to get the policy fully subscribed.\"The claims record had to be taken into account when renewing the International Group's reinsurance contract, but Spendlove said it was too early to speculate about rates this far ahead of its renewal in February.Marine insurance rates are still generally falling, but some P&I market sources believe this trend will soon be reversed in the face of rising claims costs.Insurance broker Sedgwick said in a recent report that rates now being offered to new business were frequently uneconomic.On the question of agreeing a new maximum limit for club cover, Spendlove said he expected that a consensus would eventually be reached to reduce the limit from the current compromise of $20 billion.However, he emphasised that there must be broad agreement on the new limit within the International Group's mutual framework.\"We are committed to a lower limit, but we are also committed to the integrity of the system.\"Spendlove said the revised limit would probably be in the area of $2-3 billion, which was the level favoured by a majority of West of England members in a recent survey.In its annual report, the West of England club said total free reserves at February 20 stood at $84 million versus $57 million a year earlier.Net assets advanced to $460 million from $400 million.Total tonnage insured by the club was up five percent at 47.6 million gross tonnes.-- John Sanders, Reuters Insurance News 44 171 542 2769", "label": ["C151", "C15", "C33", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The following are key extracts from South African Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals' address to the central bank's annual meeting On Tuesday:- - - -\"From the middle of February 1996 to the middle of August 1996 the average weighted value of the rand against a basket of currencies of South Africa's major trading partners depreciated by 20 percent. At this juncture, it continues to need coolheadedness from both policy makers and currency traders to restore stability to the foreign exchange market.Not only the external economic relations of South Africa, but also domestic economic activity changed significantly from 1995 to the first half of 1996. Although the rate of overall real economic expansion has been retained at last year's level of about 3.5 per cent, the primary sectors of production, and particularly agriculture and non-gold mining, have since replaced manufacturing and the services sectors as the prime movers of the economy.The growth in overall expenditure, however, continues to outpace growth in total production with the result that large imports of goods and services are required to maintain equilibrium between overall demand and supply. The current account of the balance of payments therefore remains in deficit and, in light of the decline in the net capital now become a matter of concern from a macroeconomic policy point of view.The maintenance of the expansion in domestic demand continues to depend heavily on the extension of more bank credit which not only contributes to an unacceptably high rate of increase in the money supply, but also leads the country towards an untenable debt positin where an unduly high share of the current income of both government and households will be claimed for debt servicing. This dangerous prospect holds a serious warning for the banking sector to apply greater caution in their lending operations. It also dictates the need to continue with a restrictive overall monetary policy. Despite growing pressure from different sources for the relaxation of monetary policy, the Reserve Bank, in the interests of medium-term financial stability and longer-term sustainable eonomic growth and development, must persist on its current course of responsible monetary restraint.\"- - - -\"In this, the fourth year of the current economic upswing, there are clear signals of a cyclical slow down in the rate of economic growth. Although the rate of expansion in the country's gross domestic product is still set on course to achieve about 3 per cent growth for 1996, the main impetus for growth is now being provided by a recovery in the agricultural sector, following the adverse climatic conditions during the 1994/95 season. At the same time, steady growth in the output of the non-gold mining indusry continues to lend support to the overall growth rate. In contrast, the real value added by the manufacturing sector which expanded by nearly 11 per cent in the first half of 1995, increased by only 2 per cent in the second half of last year, before declining by about 1 per cent during the first half of 1996. The contribution of the services sector to growth has likewise slowed down with its total real value added increasing by less than 2 per cent in the first half of 1996, compared with 4.5 per cent during the second half of last year.Total domestic expenditure continued to show erratic changes from quarter to quarter, but generally it increased at a rate higher than the increase in total domestic production. After 5.5 per cent growth in 1995, total real gross domestic expenditure increased at a lower average annualised rate of 3.5 per cent in the first half of 1996. Some slowdown in the rate of expansion of private consumption expenditure and smaller additions to inventories were partly offset by an acceleration in the rate of increase in consumption expenditure by general government, which rose by 3 per cent in the first half of 1996. Real gross domestic fixed investment did not maintain its relatively high rate of expansion of more than 10 per cent last year. Nevertheless, it still increased by 6 per cent in the first half of 1996. \"Two major structural deficiencies of the South African economy were again tellingly exposed by the developments of the past year. Firstly, gross domestic saving continued to decline to a level of only 16.5 percent of gross domestic product. This was clearly not sufficient to finance in a non-inflationary way gross domestic investment equal to 19 per cent of gross domestic product, which in itself was still inadequate to sustain more rapid econmic growth. The decline in the net inflow of foreign capital during the first half of 1996, which made less funds available for financing real investment, provided a strong reminder of the urgent need for a significant improvement in the propensity of the economy to save. Similarly, with domestic saving at a low level compared to many other countries at the same stage of economic development, the present deficit on the budget of the Government of about 5 percent of gross domestic product also becomes unsustainable.Secondly, despite the better economic growth performance over the past three years, very few additional job opportunities were created. In 1995 total employment in the formal non_agricultural sectors of the economy rose by only 0,6 per cent. Taking account of the growth in the labour force of more than 2.5 per cent per annum, the total number of unemployed people increased by some 280,000 last year. Unemployment remains the most intractable economic problem of South Africa, and drastic measures are needed to raise the labour absorption capacity of the economy. This problem, reflecting a serious structural weakness, cannot be solved by means of normal periodic cyclical economic recoveries, nor by any artificial stimulation of the economic growth rate. The Government's recently announced macroeconomic policy strategy contains encouraging prospects to make some progress in containing the growing number of unemployed over time.\"  \"Triggered by an unfortunate combination of certain changes in the international financial markets, particularly in the United States of America, and several economic and political developments in South Africa that were construed to be unfavourable, the maket in foreign exchange displayed unexpected turmoil starting in February 1996.An initial depreciation in the weighted exchange rate of the rand of 9 per cent from 13 February 1996 up to the end of March 1996 could still be justified in terms of underlying economic fundamentals such as inflation differentials, purchasing power parity, a weakening of South Africa's competitiveness in the international markets, and the growing deficit in the current account of the balance of payments. The subsequent further depreciation of 11 per cent from the end of March 1996 up to the end of July, however, could hardly be explained or justified in terms of these basic economic fundamentals. Unfounded rumours, speculative transactions and negative viws of the South African socio_political situation, forced the exchange rate of the rand to a value which now surely does not reflect the true economic potential of the country.\"- - - -\"It was fortunate that the depreciation of the rand occurred at a time when the Reserve Bank had no foreign liabilities outstanding, while it had also succeeded in reducing its net oversold foreign exchange position from over US$20 billion at one stage to only $8.1 billion at the end of February 1996. Thus, the net losses reflected in the forward foreign exchange position of the Bank were restricted to a smaller amount than would have been the case with a similar depreciatn at any other stage during the pst three years. This net oversold position has, however, increased again to over $15 billion as the Bank intervened in the forward foreign exchange market at the sliding exchange rate, mainly to enable importers to cover future commitments and to make use f available foreign financing facilities. It is true that an increase in the net oversold foreign exchange position of the Reserve Bank inevitably increases the risk of possible losses from future exchange rate changes. Such losses will eventually become ecoverable from taxpayers. This risk must, however, be measured against the costs to the taxpayers in general of a further fall in the exchange rate with accompanying higher interest and inflation rates. There is no costless way to adjust the  economy downwards in a situation where the inflow of capital from abroad has fallen so abruptly as was the case in South Africa earlier this year.\"\"The excessive rate of increase in bank credit extended to the private sector...remains a matter of concern, not only because of its effect on the money supply, but also because of the rising levels of indebtedness of private houseolds. As pointed out in the Annual Economic Report, accumulated household debt has now risen to more than 66 per cent of personal disposable income. The stage has been reached where the average South African household has to earmark almost six weeks' of is annual income for the sole purpose of servicing the cost of its debt.This situation also casts some doubt on the quality of the loan book of banking institutions. Controlling the amount of credit extension in an economy, when it has developed to the state in which South Africa now finds itself, cannot entirely rely on interest rates. Many of the more recent participants in the market economy remain relatively insensitive to interest rate changes since they base their applications for loans almost entirel on disposable income. Borrowers and lenders must become more aware of the inherent dangers involved in the extension of credit beyond the capacity to service debt on a sustained basis. Many South African households have already moved beyond these limits and may be heading towards a debt trap.For good reason, interest rates in South Africa remain high. The level of interest rates cannot be dictated by the needs of borrowers alone, just as they cannot be fixed solely by the demands of lenders. In the final analysis, interest rates must be determined by the underlying demand for and supply of loanable funds. The huge demand for funds emanating from general government, the business sector and private households, must be matched with the limited amount of domestic saving plus an amount of medium and longer-term foreign investment funds that can reasonably be expected to flow into the country. This simplified macroeconomic truism confirms that South Africa, with its low savings and high consumption propensities, cannot have low interest rates for any length of time without running the risk of persistent high inflation. The upward pressure on interest rates is further exacerbated by the present overall balance of payments deficit.\"- - - -\"For monetary policy purpose it is of the utmost importance that the fiscal deficit and dissaving by government be reduced further. This will alleviate the burden on monetary policy to maintain financial stability,and thereby also allow for lower interest rates.\"- - - -\"Since February 1996, the net level of foreign caital inflows diminished, and a shortage of foreign exchange developed in the market because of the large deficit in the current account of the balance of payments. The Reserve Bank has had to provide some foreign exchange from its reserves to maintain liqidity in the foreign exchange market, and more particularly to enable importers to continue to meet their commitments in respect of goods already ordered some months before. The new situation of an overall deficit in the balance of payments is now effectively draining liquidity from the domestic money and capital markets, and exerting upward pressure on interest rates.\"- - - -\"Under current conditions, the monetary authorities must rely heavily on market forces to restore equilibrium.The disciplinary effects of these market forces are unfortunately not lways perceived to be supportive of the near-term macroeconomic objectives of government and of the expectations of businesses, private households and trade unions. Furthermore, since the relevant market forces needed to remedy an overall balance of paymets deficit invariably take time to show effect and are necessarily painful and costly, they understandably tend to be unpopular with the majority of the South African community. More particularly, a rise in interest rates at this stage, which forms one of he crucial elements in the market adjustment process, is widely regarded as unacceptable because of its adverse effect on domestic spending. This limited view, however,disregards the even more disastrous consequences for the economy of not correcting a non-sustainable deficit in the overall balance of payments.As emphasised earlier on, the Reserve Bank is pursuing a policy which is partly intended to facilitate the arduous but inevitable adjustment process to restore a greater degree of overall balance of payments equilibrium. This means the economy must eventually adjust total domestic spending to a level that can be accommodated by the total of its production capacity plus imports. It must be possible,however, to finance total imports on a durable basis wih export proceeds together with a consistent inflow of longterm foreign investment funds. In order to make the inescapable adjustment more palatable, the Reserve Bank is, in the first instance, supporting the process by selling some foreign exchange from ts foreign reserves towards alleviating the market shortage. This policy action is being supplemented, also on a temporary basis, by allowing the Bank's net oversold forward book to increase again to a higher level. The Bank is at the same time deliberatey allowing market forces to work towards the required adjustment as reflected in the depreciation of the exchange rate of the rand, the decline in the amount of liquidity available in the financial markets, and the recent rise in interest rates. It follow that without or with less Reserve Bank assistance, the market adjustment processes will have to be stepped up, and the unpleasant adaptation executed with more vigour.The Reserve Bank more than any other institution is aware of the adverse implications of high interest rates for many sectors of the economy. As part of its policy of gradual adjustment the Bank has nevertheless over the past twelve months allowed interes rates to rise, not only in nominal terms, but even more so in real terms. Monetary policy has indeed effectively been tightened as inflation declined while nominal interest rates were not lowered. Given South Africa's complex macroeconomic situation, the choice for monetary policy, however, is not only between higher or lower interest rates, but rather between high interest rates now or high inflation in the future.\"- - - - \"The present situation reflects many of the traditional constraints experienced in the past when the South African economy was at a similar stage of the business cycle.Firstly, after more than three years of economic expansion, the domestic economy is now osing some of its vigour as reflected in a slowdown in the rate of expansion in manufacturing production as well as in the services sector, and also, as could have been expected, in most of the components of gross domestic expenditure.Secondly, the overal balance of payments is in deficit because of large increases during the past two years in imports needed to supplement domestic production and to meet the requirements of large investments in both fixed capital and inventories, apart from the growing deand for consumer goods.Thirdly both bank credit extension and the money supply are increasing at excessive rates, and they lag behind the slow down in the growth of real economic activity. This may reflect some distress borrowing, but may also be due to sructural changes in the South African economy. Over the medium term, however, the rates of increase in the monetary aggregates must be reduced and again brought more in line with the growth rate in nominal gross domestic product.Fourthly, interest rates remain under upward pressure, and are placing an increasing burden on government, businesses and private households. The balance of payments deficit at its present level is obviously not sustainable, particularly after the substantal decline in the net capital inflow since February 1996. The challenge for macroeconomic policy at present is to assess whether the current slow down in economic growth will be sufficient to correct the external imbalance, and whether the current monetar policy stance is restrictive enough to underpin this unavoidable adjustment process. In this assessment, account must also be taken of the expected effects of the depreciation of the rand on imports and exports, which will only work through with some considerable time lag.The Reserve Bank's view is that, in the present situation, the Bank should provide some assistance to the market in foreign exchange by selling foreign currency from the official reserves, supplemented by available foreign credit facilites, if necessary. The Bank should also support the money market to assist banking institutions in bridging the period of transition to more stable conditions. In this way, the unavoidable but painful adjustments will become more tolerable. At the same time macroeconomic corrective market forces must not be impeded, but deliberately encouraged, where necessary, to restore balance of payments equilibrium with a minimum of disruption. Exporters have an important part to play in this adjustment process by taking advantage of the current favourable exchange rate. The need for a downward adjustment in the rate of expansion in total economic activity will, of course, be reduced considerably if more long_term foreign investment funds can be attracted. The  effective implementation of the Government's Macroeconomic Strategy for Growth, Employment and Redistribution can make an important contribution towards creating a more friendly investment environment, for both foreign and South African investors. It also remains o crucial importance that the present wave of crime and violence be seen to be curtailed, and that greater confidence be gained in our determination as well as ability to achieve our longer-term economic goals in the interest of all the people of this country.\"", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "M13", "M132", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "U.S. officials said on Tuesday that they called off negotiations with Britain for a new \"open skies\" aviation agreement after receiving what they said was a disappointing offer from London.The U.S. decision to call off talks scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday in Washington surprised London and cast doubt over a proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines.\"The U.K. proposal that was provided fell so far short of providing the essential elements of an open skies agreement, it did not provide the basis for discussion,\" U.S. Transportation Department spokesman Bill Mosley said.He said the two sides remained in touch and that the United States was ready to resume negotiations if \"the basis for productive talks can be developed.\"Another U.S. official said the ball was in Britain's court to resume talks on the open skies agreement.\"Our impression after reading their proposal is either they don't want an agreement or they don't want one soon,\" said a U.S. official who asked not to be identified. \"They don't appear yet to have bought into the open skies concept.\"U.S. approval of the proposed alliance between British Airways and American is conditioned on a new agreement that removes restrictions on flights to London's Heathrow airport. U.S. officials have said such an agreement was necessary before the proposed controversial alliance could be granted antitrust immunity.British Airways shares fell Tuesday after the talks were called off. Shares of AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, were unchanged in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.In London, British officials expressed surprise at the U.S. decision to cancel talks.\"We are quite surprised at their reaction to our proposals, which we thought went quite a long way towards opening access to Heathrow,\" said a Department of Transport spokeswoman.She declined to say whether this spelled the end of the latest attempt in five years of abortive meetings to get an agreement.\"The two sides remain in touch,\" she said.The United States is looking for an agreement with Britain identical to one signed with Germany in May, a U.S. official said.Specifically, the United States wants access for all U.S. carriers to Heathrow airport, Europe's most popular airport. A major hurdle in the talks are U.S. demands for rights for its carriers to fly from Britain to third countries.Pricing and ground handling are also major issues, a U.S. official said.Previous efforts at getting open skies have foundered on the Heathrow issue and demands by Britain for the United States to lift its 25 percent ceiling on foreign ownership of its airlines.American Airlines had no immediate comment on the latest development.Last month, company officials indicated they would look for an alternative major European airline with which to form an alliance if the British Airwayd deal fell through.

It has applied for a twice weekly service to Seoul in South Korea on Friday.Hui said there has been a 20 per cent drop in cargo selling rates over the past six months.\"But I'm not surprised, the market is very competive, very seasonal and slow in the first half.

{"token": "U.S. Treasuries finished lower on Monday on the eve of a Federal Reserve meeting at which policymakers are expected to leave interest rates unchanged.Market analysts said selling by hedge funds and central banks pushed prices lower early in the session. After that, prices stabilized at their lower levels, quietly trading in extremely narrow ranges for the remainder of the session.There was no new economic data. As usual, Fed officials made no public comments immediately ahead of their Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy meeting.\"The activity on the way down ... was pretty heavy for a summer Monday, particularly one with no data being released,\" said analysts at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.But a test of further downside in the mid-morning found no followthrough and traders began to settle in from there to wait out the outcome of Tuesday's FOMC meeting, they said.Prices did edge up from session lows but several factors might have hurt efforts to lift prices further, said analysts.First, the Commodity Research Bureau's (CRB) index of commodity futures prices rose a sharp 2.42 points to 251.97, a noticeable event for the inflation-wary bond market.\"Then (Republican presidential candidate Bob) Dole made a surprising gain in the (voter public opinion) polls,\" said Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at I.D.E.A., an independent economic advisory firm.Stiles said no doubt many people think a Dole presidency would be good for the financial markets but \"there are more people who find his shift in emphasis from budget-cutting to tax-cutting is not bond-friendly.\"Also, most economic data released in the last week \"came in a little stronger than expected,\" Stiles said.Stiles cited \"some uneasiness\" about how low the jobless claims trend has been. He said that wariness was appropriate.The four-week moving average for new jobless claims fell to a seven-year low in the week ended August 10, the government reported on Thursday.\"As the weeks go by, it's harder to discount the low level of new claims as aberrant,\" said Stiles.And while analysts appear unanimous in their expectation that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged at the FOMC meeting on Tuesday, they are more divided about the future.Jim Glassman, senior economist at Chase Securities Inc, said Fed policymakers appear reluctant to signal a change in the direction of policy just yet because they assume that economic growth will slow to two percent and unemployment will remain around 5-1/2 percent.\"Even so, all roads seem to be leading to higher rates,\" Glassman said. \"Consumers have spending power and the drop in new jobless claims implies the economy is robust, he said.\"More important for the direction of interest rates, the economy already is operating at a level of resource use that has proven in the past to be inflationary,\" said Glassman.At the close, three- and six-month bill rates were each up one basis point to 5.05 percent and 5.12 percent, respectively. The one-year bill rate rose two basis poitns to 5.34 percent.The 6-1/4 percent two-year note slipped 1/32 to 100-17/32, its yield at 5.95 percent.The five-year note fell 3/32 to close at 101-8/32, yielding 6.33 percent.

The weekend rain that fell in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota was forecast to move east Monday, bringing rain to eastern Iowa, southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois, and by Wednesday most Midwest areas should be dry, said Fred Gesser, meteorologist with Weather Express Inc.High temperatures across the Midwest should range from the high 70s- to low 80s-degrees Fahrenheit this week, with lows in the low 50s Tuesday and low 60s by late week.The spring wheat areas of the Dakotas and central Minnesota should be mostly warm and dry, allowing for advances in the spring wheat harvest.  Gesser said Hurricane Edouard, a powerful storm now in the south central Atlantic, made it difficult to formulate long-term forecasts. The hurricane was heading northeast toward Florida, but has ample time to change course to the north, he said.The path it takes could affect rainfall and temperature forecasts for the Midwest. However, it will be the end of this week before Edouard nears land.Gesser and Solberg said Edouard is a strong Category 3 hurricane on a scale of five, with five the most powerful.

{"token": "An aid agency said an aircraft would try to land in southern Sudan on Thursday to bring out six Roman Catholic missionaries freed by rebels after being held for nearly two weeks.The six including three Australian nuns were released by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) on Wednesday at a mission compound in the village of Mapourdit southern Sudan, aid officials said.A local SPLA commander and his men surrounded the mission and detained the three Australian nuns -- two in their 60s and 70s -- an American priest, an Italian brother and a Sudanese priest on August 17. The Mapourdit mission was then looted.The officials at Norwegian People's Aid (NPA) said heavy rain in the area might make it impossible for the light plane to land and another airstrip in the area might have to be found.\"As it's so wet the aircraft will fly over and the pilot will make the judgment whether to land. If it can't, we will take them out from another airstrip,\" Graham Wood, NPA's acting Sudan director in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, told Reuters.\"I understand from a radio contact this morning that the six are fine and that there are no problems of a serious nature but obviously they are tired,\" said Wood, adding the SPLA had made it clear the missionaries were welcome to remain in the area.He said the reason why Catholic church officials in Nairobi could not confirm the release on Wednesday night was because the radio transmitter at the Mapourdit mission had been stolen.Church officials said the missionaries were now expected to fly to the Kenyan capital Nairobi for a holiday they had originally planned to start last week, but their mission, a primary school and a dispensary would not close down.The rebels jailed four of the group, accusing them of being spies and agents of Islam after the rebels reportedly found a quotation from the Koran on a bookmark in a Bible belonging to the nuns.The Australian nuns, who were teaching at a primary school for 1,500 when they were seized, may also have tried to resist an effort by the SPLA to recruit students from the school.Australian Sisters Moira Lynch, 73, Mary Batchelor, 68, and Maureen Carey, 52, were released with American Father Michael Barton, 48, Sudanese Father Raphael Riel, 48, and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella, 28.The incident was an international embarrassment for the SPLA, the largest rebel group in the south, and SPLA leader John Garang had to issue an order for their release which took days to reach the local commander because of communication problems.Australia's foreign ministry described the charges against the missionaries of spying and spreading Islam as bizarre and church officials said it was unbelievable they were working for Islam.The United States also called for their immediate release.It was unclear if the local SPLA commander would face disciplinary action for detaining the six and refusing to free them until investigations were completed before Garang ordered their release.Mapourdit is 1,000 km (600 miles) southwest of the Sudanese capital Khartoum.The SPLA has fought Khartoum's government forces in the south since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly Christian and animist region from the Moslem, Arabised north.", "label": ["GCAT", "GREL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

About 6,500 United Nations troops, costing over $1 million a day, have been helping to implement the plan, especially the disarming of UNITA's fighters at assembly camps.Savimbi said he wanted to play a vital role in restoring stability to his country.\"I have said that President dos Santos is the president of Angola and therefore he is my president. But that does not mean necessarily that he has to give me a job.\"I can play an important role in bringing about peace and stability in Angola. I am prepared to play that role alongside the president (dos Santos) and with other opposition parties,'' Savimbi said, without elaborating.A government delegation will travel to Bailundo on Thursday to meet Savimbi to discuss a date for a meeting between Savimbi and dos Santos.

{"token": "The timing was precise, the orders crisp and the AK-47 assault rifles they fired with deadly accuracy overnight in this sleepy town had Mexicans sure of one thing on Thursday: these rebels were for real.After two months of being dismissed by the Mexican government as a mere \"pantomime,\" the self-styled Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR) in one turbulent night on Wednesday established its guerrilla credentials in blood.In six different states, it launched coordinated attacks on police and army barracks or staged propaganda acts. At least 12 people were killed and 22 wounded -- the first time the EPR has launched anything beyond small-scale attacks on military or police convoys since it first appeared on June 28.Another -- and just as serious -- casualty for many here was the long-held hope that Mexico could solve a stack of economic and political problems, including a deep economic recession, without bloodshed.Outside the local police station in Tixtla, an hour's drive north of Guerrero's glitzy Pacific tourist resort of Acapulco, the blood on the sidewalk was that of a policeman, gunned down as he tried to defend himself with an ancient rifle.Another policeman had his legs shot off as he sat at his desk inside. He later bled to death.Witnesses said some 30 gunmen, their faces covered with bandannas and wearing khaki uniforms, swept into the main square in combat formation and opened fire on police.\"I didn't believe in them at all, but seeing them I realised that the guerrillas do exist,\" said Felipe Epitazio, a policeman who traded fire with the rebels from a doorway, but found himself outnumbered and seriously outgunned.\"They are fanatical and dedicated, they have killing in their hearts ... it was a commando that knew about strategy and guerrilla war,\" added Epitazio.Residents who crouched in shops as the gunbattle raged said it was clear the rebels were well-disciplined. They ordered civilians to flee, saying they were only after police and soldiers.Apart from that, the masked rebels hardly said a word before vanishing, leaving behind them bullet-pocked buildings, spent cartridges and a feeling things in this part of Mexico have been brutally shaken up.In Huatulco, a popular Pacific resort city in southern Oaxaca state, guerrillas attacked a police office, a naval base, the town hall and another public building, killing seven and wounding seven in the surprise attacks.An eerie quiet enveloped the sprawling resort on Thursday. The guerrillas deliberately pinpointed the tourist end of town for maximum effect, market stall holder Griselda Gomez said.\"They wanted to create as much attention as they could and they did, we have had soldiers and armed police crawling all over the place all day,\" the wrinkled grandmother added.A convoy of army trucks sat on a nearby road. Nervous soldiers posted at each corner of the vehicles scrutinised the thick undergrowth, their rifles cocked at the ready.But there seemed little panic among the estimated 10,000 tourists currently in the resort. \"To tell you the truth I did not know anything had happened,\" said John Crawley, a 40-year-old computer technician from New Jersey.\"I heard a few people mention a gun battle over lunch but I had no idea that it was right here ... now I know what all the young soldiers are doing dotted around the town.\"", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "ValuJet Inc.'s stock rose Friday after federal authorities returned its operating certificate and its president said the airline would offer special lower fares to win back passengers.Stock in the low-cost airline gained $1.50, or about 14 percent, to $12.50 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market.Earlier Friday, President Lewis Jordan said the airline, which was grounded after a crash in May that cost 110 lives, would offer special low fares to attract customers after federal authorities give its planes permission to fly again.Jordan said in television interviews that the airline would continue to be a low-priced carrier and would offer the same \"affordable\" fares despite the cost of compliance with Federal Aviation Administration requirements imposed to permit it to resume operations.Jordan estimated it could be two or three weeks -- or longer if aviation agency officials have more questions -- before the airline could resume service.The company cannot advertise or take reservations until it has final approval from the Department of Transportation.As a result of the government's extensive review, Jordan said, the airline would rely on only two outside contractors for heavy maintenance and had revised its training programmes and maintenance manuals and hired a senior vice president for maintenance.He said the Department of Transportation reviewed the airline's balance sheet and determined it was financially strong enough to return to service.\"We have a lot of money in the bank,\" he said. \"We will pass along the same affordable fares that the public wants. We have over $200 million in cash. Even if we spend $50 million on the shutdown, that leaves us with a lot of cash.\"Atlanta-based ValuJet was grounded June 17 after a heightened safety inspection of the carrier following the deadly May 11 crash in the Florida Everglades.The FAA said on Thursday it had returned the carrier's operating certificate after a review found it had corrected maintenance and operation failings that led to the grounding.After a period for government review of any response to the proposed approval, the airline could fly nine planes at first and up to 15 over the next several days. Before it was grounded, ValuJet flew 51 aircraft.The shutdown and the cost of changes instituted at the airline will be a one-time charge against expenses, Jordan said.", "label": ["C13", "C152", "C15", "C31", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months, the Commerce Department said Thursday, driving prices up in a strong housing market.Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February, when new homes were selling at rate of 784,000 a year.It was the largest increase in monthly sales since an 8.8 percent rise in January and was sharply contrary to Wall Street economists' forecasts of a drop in sales to a rate of 734,000.  (May be bylined Glenn Somerville)Sales have been expected to level off or decline because mortgage rates have climbed significantly since the beginning of the year, but so far show little sign of doing so.The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said rates for a 30-year mortgage loan averaged 8.25 percent in July, down from 8.32 percent in June. But that was well above the average 7.03 percent rate available last January.Analysts said beforehand that the availability of adjustable-rate mortgages, together with rising employment and incomes, have bolstered the housing industry.On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing, or used, homes eased 0.5 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.14 million -- a second straight monthly drop, but still a higher rate than that recorded for any month in 1995.The department said June sales of new homes fell a revised 1.8 percent to 726,000 a year instead of declining 5.3 percent to 734,000 as it reported a month ago.Prices for new homes climbed strongly in July, with the median sales price jumping to a record $143,000 from $140,000 in June. The median marks the midway point for prices, with half of all new homes selling above this price and half selling below.The average sales price gained to $169,800 in July from $165,300 in June.Sales of new homes picked up during July in every region of the country except the Northeast, where they decreased 1.4 percent to an annual rate of 72,000.In the Midwest, sales soared 12.5 percent to 144,000 a year and in the West they were up 8.8 percent to an annual rate of 223,000.Sales in the South, the nation's largest regional market, rose strongly, by 7.5 percent to an annual rate of 344,000.The department noted that the sales rate for new homes has exceeded 700,000 a year in each of the first seven months of this year. That is the longest string of sales at such a brisk rate in a decade, since an eight-month period from November 1985 through June 1986.", "label": ["C31", "CCAT", "E61", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Australian Greens senators Bob Brown and Dee Margetts said on Tuesday they wanted to emulate in 1996 the results achieved by the minor parties in the Senate after the 1993 budget.  \"Because the Greens stood up to (Labor Prime Minister) Paul Keating (in 1993) there was something like A$100 million extra came out for those most vulnerable people at the bottom end of the income scale in Australia,\" Brown told reporters after the delivery of the 1996/97 federal budget.\"I would dearly love to be able to start my career in the senate for the Australian Greens in emulating that fantastic result that the two Greens delivered in Australia in terms of social justice back in 1993,\" Brown said.  \"It's not a matter of delaying the budget, it's a matter of allowing a full and proper public debate,\" Brown said.In 1993 the Australian dollar and bond markets were sold down sharply when Green and other independent senators held up passage of some budget bills for over a month.Brown, Margetts, the left-leaning Democrats and independent Brian Harradine can block legislation put forward by the governing Liberal/National coalition when voting with the opposition Labor party.  The Greens, the Democrats and Labor have said they would not block the appropriations bills, which effectively gives the government the money needed to spend on day-to-day affairs.The government would have to shut down eventually without these bills.\"Those areas where we are required to make a decision, personally I take that very seriously and make sure that by the time I am required to make a decision I have the best information upon which to do that,\" Margetts said.New revenue measures often require separate legislation which would have to pass the Senate.  Treasurer Peter Costello said earlier on Tuesday that there were some measures in the budget which could be knocked back by the Senate.Costello delivered a budget projecting an underlying deficit of A$5.65 billion in the year to June 30, 1997, including A$3.9 billion of deficit cuts.Labor Treasury spokesman Gareth Evans earlier said Labor would vote against a hike in fees for university students.The increased Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) charges were projected to save A$1.77 billion over the next four years.    -- Canberra bureau 61-6 273-2730", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Britain's Department of Transport said on Tuesday it was surprised by the decision by the U.S. to cancel \"open skies\" talks due to be held this week aimed at opening the transatlantic airline market to free competition.Earlier the U.S. Department of Transportation said it had called off the meeting because of lack of progress on agreeing terms for open skies, which include a longstanding U.S. request for more U.S. airlines to have access to London Heathrow.\"We are quite surprised at their reaction to our proposals which we thought went quite a long way towards opening access to Heathrow,\" said a Department of Transport spokeswoman.  She declined to say whether this spelled the end of the latest attempt in five years of abortive meetings to get an agreement. \"The two sides remain in touch,\" she said.Talks for \"open skies\" reopened in July after British Airways and American Airlines called for the market to be opened up to competition as a necessary condition for approving their controversial alliance plans.The U.S. government has made any approval of the BA/American alliance conditional on getting open skies with Britain, and in particular on obtaining open access for all U.S. carriers to London Heathrow, Europe's most popular airport.  Previous efforts at getting open skies have foundered on the Heathrow issue and a demand by Britain for the U.S. to lift its 25 percent ceiling on foreign ownership of its airlines.But airline industry sources said on Tuesday that it was believed a U.S. demand for onward \"fifth freedom\" rights for its airlines to fly from Britain to third countries was proving to be a major hurdle in talks this time.Although this week's meeting was billed as an interim session focusing on technical issues the sources said that U.S. negotiators thought Britain was going to use the meeting to informally explore the possibilities for a compromise deal.  This was because British officials had asked that airline lobbyists from both sides should not be briefed on how the talks were proceeding and that they had constructive proposals.But in the event none were forthcoming when officials got Britain's proposed agenda for the meeting last Friday, which the sources said focused on trying to agree ways of policing an open market to ensure fair competition for smaller carriers.\"The U.S. side had hoped for a compromise proposal so when it (the agenda) arrived they were disappointed...It all looked rather stale,\" a source with one airline said.-- Greg Mahlich, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717", "label": ["C13", "CCAT", "E51", "E512", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Russian and rebel military commanders finally met in Chechnya on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President Boris Yeltsin's envoy Alexander Lebed.The Russian army commander in the region, General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, arrived at the rebel-held village of Novye Atagi, some 20 km (12 miles) south of the Chechen capital Grozny for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov.But Lebed himself, the Kremlin security chief, is still waiting back in Moscow to meet Yeltsin over his plans for a lasting political settlement in Chechnya.Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Kremlin press service as saying Yeltsin, who left for a state holiday home near Moscow on Monday, would hold no working meetings on Tuesday.Lebed interrupted talks with Chechnya's separatists on a political deal on Sunday, saying he had to consult with Yeltsin.After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday, Lebed's spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday. But Yeltsin's spokesman rebuffed the suggestion, saying the president had left Moscow for a holiday near the capital.The Russians postponed the talks after a Chechen band disarmed a column of interior ministry troops on Sunday.The Chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned. The Russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken.Tass said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by Lebed and Maskhadov last Thursday would be on the agenda of today's talks. Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting, which started around 10.45 a.m. (0645 GMT).Also in Novye Atagi on Tuesday morning, was Tim Guldimann, the Swiss diplomat who heads the Chechnya mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Guldimann, who helped broker an earlier truce in May, was not taking part in the Tikhomirov-Maskhadov talks.Lebed's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20-month-old conflict. However, tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained.Three Russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight, Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian military as saying on Tuesday morning.RIA news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint Russian-Chechen police patrols in some districts of the capital Grozny on Tuesday.But the separatist command told Interfax news agency the patrols, part of the truce brokered by Lebed last week, would begin on Tuesday after delays for \"technical reasons\".Yeltsin's spokesman said he might meet officials during his break, but indicated Lebed was low on the list by saying Yeltsin would need time to study the proposals before talking to him.Russian news agencies also quoted the Kremlin spokesman as saying that Lebed's representatives had not sought a meeting, hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol.Yeltsin, 65, has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July, prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll, weakening his grip on affairs of state.Aides have dismissed such speculation, insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign.Some analysts say the Kremlin leader, whose order sending troops and tanks into Chechnya in 1994 started Russia's ill-fated military campaign, could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart.But Lebed, who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in Moscow working against him, appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from Yeltsin.His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists' demand for independence and Moscow's insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian Federation.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Top seed and defending champion Pete Sampras survived a second-round fright at the U.S. Open on Friday after being pushed to the limit by young Czech Jiri Novak.Sampras had to summon all his championship fortitude against the 21-year-old with limited Grand Slam experience to pull out a 6-3 1-6 6-4 4-6 6-4 victory that, by the end, had the fans on the edge of their seats.\"I think that experience might have come through in the end. I never really felt like I was going to lose,\" said Sampras.Earlier in the match, Sampras had that familiar head-down, hangdog look that he gets when things aren't going well. It was especially pronounced at 4-5 in the fourth set when he was serving to stay alive in the set but pushed a forehand wide, giving Novak the break and the fourth set.\"After I lost the fourth the crowd really got behind me and got my adrenaline going,\" Sampras said.\"This is it, the fifth set at the U.S. Open, either you go home tomorrow or you stick around. I decided to stick around.\"By the middle of the fifth set, the three-time U.S. Open champion's head was up and there was fire in his dark, Greek eyes.The big break for the world number one came in the fifth game while the 47th-ranked Novak was serving at 2-2, 15-40 after two costly double faults.The Czech ended a long baseline rally by netting a backhand and Sampras pumped his fists exuberantly, psyching himself up to close out the match.\"I think it was the most important moment of the match,\" said Novak, who had never faced a number one player or played on centre court at a Grand Slam.Sampras held his next serve for 4-2 with a leaping backhand volley followed by another pump of the fist and a roar from the crowd.But Novak was apparently too inexperienced to realise he should have been intimidated by waking the sleeping tiger and promptly held his next serve with the help of his 14th ace and a service winner.Each held his next service game at 15 -- Sampras with a huge forehand that ticked off the baseline and Novak with a sizzling service winner -- and the champion was serving for the match.There was no lack of drama in the final game.A Sampras double fault gave Novak a break point, but the top seed responded with another big forehand that Novak returned into the net for deuce.Sampras followed that by belting a 124 mile per hour (200 kph) ace that set up the thrilling match point.Novak answered a Sampras volley with a deep lob the American chased almost to the wall before hitting a towering defensive lob that the wind held just inside the sideline.\"I didn't know where it was going to go...it could have gone right out of the stadium, but it managed to stay in,\" Sampras said, smiling.Also apparently surprised the ball landed in, Novak dumped a forehand into the net, ending a match he will remember for a long time.\"I think it was the best atmosphere and and the best match of my life for me,\" said Novak, who received a rousing ovation for his efforts.\"He's a strong player,\" said Sampras. I definitely was pushed to the limit.\"  :While Sampras survived his scare the other player who won the Open in 1990 was not so fortunte.Fan favourite Gabriela Sabatini, seeded 15th, was undone in the third round by 14 double faults and the aggressive play of Sweden's Asa Carlsson 7-5 3-6 6-2.\"This is the biggest victory of my career,\" said Carlsson, who had never been past the second round of a Grand Slam before.\"I guess I'll have to accept that I lost,\" said Sabatini, who missed much of the year with a pulled stomach muscle.\"This is a big tournament for me. This is where I really wanted to do well.\"Eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport sailed into the round of 16, extending her current winning streak to 14 with a 6-0 6-3 win over Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France.And former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez of Spain, seeded fourth, took out two-time Open runner-up Helena Sukova 6-4 6-3.In a reversal of years of U.S. Open misfortune, fourth seed Goran Ivanisevic joined Sampras in the men's third round, holding off Australian Scott Draper in four sets.And 1993 Open runner-up Cedric Pioline of France, the 16th seed, got by Spaniard Roberto Carretero after dropping the first set.One men's seed went down in a minor upset when 17th-seeded clay court specialist Felix Mantilla of Spain was upended by veteran Frenchman Guy Forget in straight sets.", "label": ["GCAT", "GSPO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Ukraine will introduce a new currency, the hryvna, from September 2, the head of the central bank said on Sunday. It will knock five zeroes off the former Soviet republic's unwieldy inflation-hit prices.\"The president signed a decree on currency reform today,\" National Bank of Ukraine chief Viktor Yushchenko said.Hryvna notes will be exchanged for the existing karbovanets currency between September 2 and 16, he said.  \"The goals of the reform are to change our interim currency into a true currency, to streamline prices, and to create a stable currency.\"The most obvious effect will be to slim down price tags that became bewildering strings of zeroes in the hyperinflation that struch after Ukraine became independent of the Soviet Union exactly five years ago.One hryvna will be worth 100,000 karbovanets, also known as \"coupons.\"  After the exchange, the hryvna would be stabilized at around 1.75 to 1.76 to the dollar, deputy prime minister Viktor Pynzenyk said during the announcement. That is close to the equivalent karbovanets rate on Sunday of 180,000 per dollar.Banknotes denominated in hryvna, the currency used during the times of the Kiev Rus empire about 1,000 years ago, were printed in Canada and Britain and have been in banks' possession ready for circulation for about two years.\"Today we're very happy that the hryvna has once again returned to Kiev and we wish it luck, that it keeps on the path of stability,\" Yushchenko said.  The karbovanets slipped from 176,100 to the dollar at the weekend amid strong rumors of the hryvna's introduction during this weekend's Independence Day holiday.Ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna as a \"permanent currency\" since independence in 1991 but has had to postpone the permanent currency in past years because of economic problems.Pynzenyk said the stablized karbovanets and record-low inflation rates of 0.1 percent in June and July presented perfect conditions for introduction of a new currency.  Yushchenko said he expected a $1.5 billion hryvna stabilization fund from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be agreed on next month.IMF officials said that the special fund was still under discussion following the visit of a two-week mission to Kiev.\"Introduction of a new currency does not depend on the IMF,\" he said.Both officials spent a good deal of time reassuring Ukrainians, nervous of change in a precarious economic situation, that their savings would not be eroded when the hryvna was introduced.  \"We are trying to bring in the most transparent reform possible and people seem to have accepted this announcement without a great deal of agitation,\" Pynzenyk said.The new money will be made available at 20,000 exchange points across Ukraine, Yushchenko said, and added that the exchange period may be extended if necessary.Banknotes will be in denominations of one, two, five, 10, 20 and 50 and would also include coins.The karbovanets has remained steady at about 176,000 to the dollar for the past three months.The interim currency was trading at about 87,000 to the dollar when President Leonid Kuchma introduced his economic reform program in October 1994, but fell to an all-time low of about 191,000 to the dollar in March.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "M13", "M132", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) on Tuesday reported first half 1996 pre-tax profits slightly up on the same period last year, but said the full-year result could be slightly weaker than the record profits of 1995.SAS said first half pre-tax profits rose to 1.05 billion Swedish crowns from 1.04 billion during the same period last year. The result was slightly lower than market expectations.The carrier, which is partially owned by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Denmark, said group operating revenue fell to 17.44 billion Swedish crowns from 17.74 billion.A statement said an earlier forecast of somewhat weaker full-year income before the sale of fixed assets compared with 1995 remained unchanged.\"Last year was a record year,\" SAS chief executive officer Jan Stenberg told reporters. \"We cannot all the time continue to beat new world records. Our profitability is very good compared to the rest of the European airline industry.\"Full-year 1995 pre-tax profits were 2.63 billion Swedish crowns and it was especially the third quarter that lifted the results, Stenberg said.Operating income in the second 1996 quarter fell by 241 million crowns to 830 million -- mainly because a stronger Swedish crown had a negative effect on revenues in foreign currency not fully compensated for by positive effects on expenses in foreign currencies.\"Part of the profit increase we would otherwise have seen we won't see because tickets sold in dollars and French franc are worth less in Swedish crowns,\" Stenberg said.The Swedish crown has strengthened by six percent since the beginning of the year while the trend in the first half of 1995 was a weaking of eight percent.The statement said the alliance with Germany's Lufthansa continued to meet expectations. Traffic included in the SAS/Lufthansa joint venture rose by 11 percent in the first half while production increased by six percent.With the exception of domestic traffic in Sweden and Denmark, all route sectors showed an incease of seven to 10 percent compared with the first half of 1995.But the statement said increased competition between the Scandinavian capitals of Stockholm, Oslo and Copenhagen and on some European routes made forecasting conditions for the second half difficult.After enjoying a virtual monopoly in Scandinavian skies for 50 years, SAS is now being challenged on its home base. Several airlines have recently moved into the skies traditionally dominated by SAS, undercutting its passenger prices which remain some of the highest in the world.\"We'll beat them,\" Stenberg said. \"We are not going to sit back and let the competitors take over parts of our market. We have a battery or rather artillery of means to combat competitors. We have our traffic system, we have our timetable, our service concept, our prices, we have got Eurobonus.\"\"We can arrange our prices so that they are competitive too. We have already announced price cuts on some flights to Brussels,\" he said.Virgin Express, run by Britain's high-flying entrepreneur Richard Branson, has announced the start of daily cheap flights between Copenhagen and Brussels from September. Norwegian airline Braathens SAFE has been given approval to run up to nine daily flights between Oslo and Stockholm from this autumn -- a route once tightly controlled by SAS.", "label": ["C152", "C15", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected.Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar.Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week. Should Rubin leave, Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him.Rubin's predecessor at the Treasury, Lloyd Bentsen, was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan.\"Obviously, under the Clinton administration, we've seen two distinctively different dollar policies,\" said Chris Widness, an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. \"Under Rubin, the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar.\"That strategy, backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention, helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8, 1995, and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19, 1995. Currently, the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen.Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar's comeback, using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on Wall Street, part of which were spent as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs and Co. Inc.\"Rubin has done a fine job in that position,\" said Michael Faust, a portfolio manager at Bailard, Biehl and Kaiser, which manages just under $1 billion in global stocks and bonds.\"Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill.\"Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets. Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening.As for U.S. Treasury securities, Widness explained that Alan Greenspan's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury.\"Although, if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation, it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States,\" said Widness, adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and, to a lesser degree, bonds.Still, markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results. If that is true, then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency.\"If he left, the first question people would ask the next guy is, 'What's your view on the dollar?'\" said Michael Perelstein, portfolio manager of MainStay International Funds.\"And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they'd better say exactly the same thing (as Rubin), if not stronger,\" Perelstein said. \"Otherwise, you get selling out of Tokyo and Frankfurt again.\"", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Imported U.S. soybeans and products were set to retain their prominent position in European feeds markets in the 1996/97 campaign, an American Soybean Association (ASA) leader said on Monday.\"Europeans have been, and will continue to be, our largest regional customers, to meet their protein and oil demands,\" said ASA chief executive officer Stephen Censky.\"Eastern European rapeseed crops are very poor this year -- in Poland they're talking about a 60 percent loss,\" he said.  \"That means their oil supplies will be down and less oil on the world market should hopefully make U.S. soy oil more competitive as demand comes up,\" he said.\"But the big unknown factor is how much oil China is going to import.\"Censky spoke to Reuters during a reception hosted by the local ASA office for a U.S. delegation on a visit to Hungary and Germany.Depending on the year, Germany is the third or fourth largest export market for U.S. soybeans, importing around two million tonnes.  Censky said competing South American producers had been very aggressive in marketing their crops and the ASA had noted Brazilian government moves to eliminate ICMS tax in Brazil.This tax is currently charged at a higher rate for the fob export price of soybeans than for the export of oil and meal, indirectly subsidising product exports.\"We know it's a mixed bag on the elimination of that tax. If it went it would mean perhaps products from the U.S. will be more competitive yet the South Americans are going to become more competitive on their whole bean exports,\" Censky said.  Referring to low USDA August 12 estimates of a 2.30 billion bushels bean crop, Censky said, \"Projections are for a good crop but there are other concerns about it being a later planted crop and about some of the cool weather we've had.\"Asked about the impact of the madcow crisis in Europe, which put consumers off beef because of associated health risks, Censky said soybeans should not be affected.\"A lot of soymeal is used in pork and poultry feed, not in feed for ruminants,\" he said.  \"We would see increased usage of soymeal in the rations for those animals to the extent that consumers would replace beef in their diet with pork or poultry.\"Censky also said ASA would step up efforts to promote U.S.-produced genetically modified soybeans in Europe.-Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275", "label": ["M141", "M14", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Deve Gowda asking for the suspension of all telecommunications licences granted during Sukh Ram's tenure.Under India's telephone privatisation programme, the previous Congress government awarded licences to dozens of private joint ventures, involving Indian and foreign companies, to operate cellular and basic services.A fourth round of bidding to grant basic service licences in remaining zones has not yet been scheduled.\"I sincerely hope that none of the earlier decisions will be reconsidered because of revelations made now,\" Chidambaram told reporters.\"I hope that those who have been given licences will move forward to implement those licences.\"The minister said he was not aware of any impact from the suspected scandal on the privatisation process. \"But I hope that the process will not be stalled,\" he said.Chidambaram said the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector was high on the 13-party United Front government's agenda and it would ensure that the process moved forward.\"The process of liberalisation in the telecommunications sector and introduction of private investments in the basic telecommunications services must go forward and I am confident will go forward,\" Chidambaram said.Sukh Ram's whereabouts were still a mystery on Wednesday, five days after the CBI raided his homes.Chidambaram said the Deve Gowda government was trying to remove the perception of corruption, which was one of the reasons that led to the defeat of the previous government.\"We want it (corruption) to be minimised if not totally eliminated. But sometimes I am afraid some of these traders also encourage and feed corruption,\" Chidambaram said.", "label": ["C183", "C18", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Pakistan was not a declared nuclear power but U.S. experts believe it capable of producing nuclear weapons quickly.The existence of such a missile plant would add a new dimension to collaboration between the two states, including the military and nuclear fields. This has troubled Washington and was a factor in a souring of Sino-U.S. relations last year.A White House spokesman said he could not confirm the story but said the United States took such reports seriously.\"We do not believe it is in the best interests of the United States or of any other country to supply Pakistan with the capacity to manufacture or deploy weapons of mass destruction,\" the spokesman said.The Washington Post said the partially completed factory in a suburb of the northern city of Rawalpindi was expected to be capable of producing most of the major components of a missile modelled on the Chinese-designed M-11 in a year or two.The same newspaper reported in June that U.S. intelligence agenices had \"unanimously concluded\" that Pakistan had already obtained complete M-11 missiles from China, but both China and Pakistan denied that report.The United States has twice imposed limited economic sanctions against China for selling M-11 missile launchers and missile components to Pakistan, but withdrew them after China promised to stop such deliveries.Washington recently settled another dispute with China over a sale to Pakistan of nuclear-related equipment.U.S. Vice President Al Gore said the United States had an \"active, vigorous programme of monitoring all exchanges of technology from China or any other country that might violate\" international agreements or treaties.\"We expect that they will comply with the provisions of the laws and treaties involved,\" Gore said in an interview on ABC's \"This Week with David Brinkley\" programme.The Post quoted officials as saying the construction of the missile factory raised the possibility that broad economic sanctions eventually could be imposed on both countries.However, the White House spokesman suggested sanctions were not immediately in the offing. \"We have not come to any conclusions that would warrant sanctions at this time with respect to Pakistan or China,\" he said.The Washington Post said the existence of the Pakistani factory had been known to U.S. intelligence officials since last year when construction evidently began.The White House has sought better relations with China after months of disputes over Taiwan, trade and human rights. Gore said a visit to Beijing by U.S. National Security Adviser Tony Lake last month resulted in a \"much more productive and open\" dialogue.Pakistan has depended increasingly on Chinese help to meet its defence needs because of virtual rupture in military ties with the United States since 1990 due to suspicions about Pakistan's nuclear programme.The sanctions were eased this year when the U.S. Congress approved delivery of some blocked equipment that was already paid for.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDEF", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, jumped to 7.0 percent, the highest since it closed at that level on July 30.Analysts said the market's pessimism started to brew late on Friday after the Fed announced summaries of discussion at its July meeting of policy-makers.The summary showed Federal Reserve officials shifted their stance toward a more restrictive monetary policy for the first time since March 1995. The Fed's decision was seen as another indication that an interest rate hike before the end of the year remains possible.\"I think it (the Fed's decision) caught a lot of investors off-guard,\" said Kevin Flanagan, first vice-president and money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We have not eliminated the prospects of a Fed tightening as many had thought.\"\"I think the bears control the ball,\" said Michael Strauss, managing director and chief financial strategist at Chase Securities Inc. \"I do expect higher rates going forward.\"Some analysts said the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond could rise to 7.25 percent.Analysts also were awaiting the government's report on August employment, which is scheduled to be released on Sept. 6.

It will be discussed by the executive boards of the IMF and the World Bank next month.The proposal is one of several concessions the IMF and the World Bank have made to critics who regard their March debt reduction plan to make lower-interest loans as being too burdensome for poor countries.Officials say the plan could cost between $5.6 billion and $7.7 billion over six years.It is still unclear whether the debt reduction initiative will be approved at this year's ministerial meetings of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington at the end of December.The plan was first called for at a summit meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1995.The United States favours gold sales to finance debt relief. However, other Western industrial countries, which control the institutions, remain divided over the wisdom of allowing the IMF to sell any of its gold when it has about $30 billion in outstanding loan commitments to Russia and Mexico.Germany leads the opposition, and is supported by Italy, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden, the newspaper said.Officials also say the so-called Paris Club of Western creditor nations is proving slow to heed a call in June by the Group of Seven at a summit meeting in France to raise the level of forgiveness offered qualifying poor countries to 90 percent of their direct debts from 67 percent.", "label": ["E51", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June.The department had previously reported a 1.6 percent rise in July durables orders, but it revised that up slightly.Orders for non-durables like food and paper products --items that are used up more quickly -- also picked up strongly in July, by 1.8 percent to $144.7 billion following a 1.2 percent decrease in June.Among durable products, the only category that showed a decline in July from June was transportation equipment, down 0.4 percent to $41.6 billion after a 1.3 percent June drop. But that was mainly because of a falloff in demand for military ships and tanks that offset a pickup in orders for new cars.Shipments of motor vehicles and parts grew by 5.4 percent in July after a 1.2 percent fall in June. In the automobile industry, shipments correspond to orders.Excluding transportation, factory orders were up 2.1 percent in July after easing in June by 0.6 percent.The biggest increase in July came in orders for electrical and electronic equipment, up 4.7 percent to $28 billion after a 3.8 percent June increase.Industrial machinery orders gained 2.9 percent to $32.6 billion following a 0.3 percent June rise.Total shipments of manufactured goods, which reflect more immediate demand than orders, increased by 1.2 percent in July to $312.7 billion after a 0.8 percent fall in June.Unfilled orders increased by 1 percent to $504.1 billion after a 0.7 percent June increase. It was the tenth increase in order backlogs in the past 11 months, indicating likely strength in manufacturing industries in coming months.Orders for non-defence capital goods, a measure of business' expansion plans, rose 0.6 percent in July after falling 0.1 percent in June. Excluding aircraft, non-defence capital goods were up by 1 percent last month after a 1 percent June drop.", "label": ["E31", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "President Bill Clinton, his hour of triumph marred by the bombshell resignation of a top aide in a sex scandal, launched his bid for a second term on Thursday with a pledge to lead America boldly into the 21st century.\"Tonight let us resolve to build that bridge to the 21st century, to meet our challenges, protect our basic values and prepare our people for the future,\" Clinton said in a speech prepared for his acceptance of the Democratic nomination.Implying he would be both a wiser and fairer leader than Republican challenger Bob Dole, and one who would replace irresponsible tax-cutting promises with sound moves to spur economic growth, he added:\"We must give Americans the tools they need to make the most of their God-given potential ... and we must build a strong united American community.\"Clinton was preceded on the podium by Vice President Al Gore, who accepted the nomination for the vice presidency in a brief speech.Gore had spoken at length on Wednesday night and made only a brief address in which he appealed \"to members of the Republican Party, the Reform Party (of Ross Perot) and independents to join us in this cause which claims our hearts.\" He called for a civil presidential campaign.Clinton could only hope his national television audience would focus on his visionary rhetoric rather than the sudden distraction of a sex scandal that forced the abrupt resignation of an aide who helped craft his very words: top campaign strategist Dick Morris.A clearly stunned White House announced only hours before the prime-time television address that Morris had resigned late on Wednesday night, shortly before a report in the New York Post that he had had a long affair with a $200-an-hour Washington call-girl.The Post picked up the report from the tabloid Star magazine.Among the things Morris had reportedly done to impress the woman, the report said, was to let her eavesdrop on a phone chat with the president himself and take advance peeks at the speeches first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore delivered to the convention earlier this week.Clinton issued a terse statement saying he valued Morris as a friend and adviser -- many credit him with devising Clinton's new \"family values\" campaign strategy -- and most analysts said they doubted it would affect the outcome of an election in which the president is heavily favoured over Dole.Still, seldom has any U.S. presidential nominee had to deliver a televised acceptance speech under circumstances as strained as these -- and especially for Clinton, a man dogged for years by character questions including allegations of sexual philandering.Senator Dianne Feinstein, a liberal California Democrat and Clinton backer, called the Morris affair \"a big bump\" for the president's campaign.\"It comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president,\" Feinstein said ruefully.Clinton could do nothing but carry on presenting the visionary message, that has so far put him well out front of Dole in opinion polls, and hope the public would pay heed.\"Our strategy (for the 21st century) is simple but profound: Opportunity for all, responsibility for all, a strong American community where everyone has a place and plays a role,\" he said.He boasted he had changed \"the old politics of Washington,\" adding, \"For too often leaders ask, 'Who's to blame?' We ask, 'What are we going to do?'\"He asserted that he and the Democrats could promote prosperity without harming social programmes they claim Dole and the Republicans would slash.\"Tonight let us proclaim to the American people, we will balance the budget, and let us also proclaim we will do it in a way that preserves Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment,\" he said.\"As long as I am president, I will never allow cuts that devastate education for our children, pollute our environment, end the guarantee of health care under Medicaid, or violate our duty to our parents under Medicare. Never.\"Clinton began his big day hoping visionary promises like that would be what America discussed round the breakfast table on Friday.Instead, it seemed the Republicans and the anti-Clinton public had another \"character\" issue to seize upon related to the 50-year-old president and his choice of controversial aides.Speaking in Santa Barbara, California, Dole did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of Morris, who had advised Clinton to chart a more centrist political course, would make the president drift back to the left.\"Morris has been trying to make President Clinton a Republican, now maybe he'll revert to the liberal Democrat that he really is,\" Dole told reporters.In Chicago, the White House entourage issued a terse statement on Clinton's behalf saying: \"Dick Morris is my friend, and he is a superb political strategist. \"I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years.\"However the affair plays out, Clinton will hit the road Friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first Democratic incumbent re-elected to a second term since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

In the \"House of Horrors\" case it was set off by underground holes which were found to contain bodies.Boudin said the two \"hot spots\" would not be excavated until Monday to give weary police time to rest after a gruelling search for bodies which has already lasted two weeks.Sniffer dogs used to locate bodies went into the cellar of the house in the Jumet suburb of the southern city of Charleroi earlier on Friday. Boudin said they too would rest at the weekend.The Jumet house was formerly occupied by Frenchman Bernard Weinstein, an accomplice who Dutroux admits murdering.Police have been excavating around the house for four days, with attention focused on a large brick shed in the garden.Boudin said this building would be completely demolished and the concrete floor removed and excavated to a depth of five metres (yards).\"We don't want to leave anything to chance,\" he said, adding that work there would also be suspended over the weekend.Boudin said investigators had found a \"hot spot\" at another house owned by Dutroux in the Marcinelle suburb of Charleroi.So far police have discovered the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo buried in the garden of another of Dutroux's houses in Sars-La Buissiere, south west of Charleroi.Two weeks ago they rescued two other sexually abused girls -- Laetitia Delhez and Sabine Dardenne -- from a dungeon in the Marcinelle house and are actively searching for at least two others -- An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks -- whom Dutroux admits kidnapping a year ago.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "MIM Holdings Ltd said on Friday that its McArthur River zinc lead and silver mine in the Northern Territory would continue to sustain losses at current metal prices and treatment charge levels unless operational efficiencies improved significantly.McArthur River recorded a loss in its first year of operation as it increased mine production toward a target of one million tonnes a year, MIM said.  A task force has been established at the mine to assess operating efficiency, transport, the use of materials and technical issues with a view to lowering costs, MIM said.MIM holds a 70 percent stake in McArthur River.MIM's Mount Isa mining and smelting businesses showed an overall profit of A$33.2 million in the 1995/96 fiscal year, versus a year-earlier loss of A$41.6 million, owing to a restoration of production and lowering of costs, it said.However, these benefits were largely offset by lower Australian-dollar copper prices and a A$10 million reallocation of revenue to its Townsville copper refinery, MIM said.  The sharp fall in the copper price and a strenghtening of the Australian dollar contributed to a loss at Mount Isa during June, MIM said. Production of each of the four metals produced at Mount Isa -- lead, zinc, copper and silver -- was higher in 1995/1996 than in the previous year, the company said.MIM said losses at its Oaky Creek coal mine worsened to A$29 million in 1995/1996 from A$22.7 million in the pervious year.Mining was adversely affected by the presence of a hard stone band in the underground coal seam and in the flooding of the underground mine in January, MIM said.  Operations have since recovered from these difficulties, MIM said. However, output will be constrained over the next two years as the mine switches to using longwall panels, it said.The company said its Newlands and Collinsville coal mines returned to profitability in 1995/1996, largely due to better operating performance and lower project debt.The lead and zinc refining operations recorded a profit of A$25.9 million in the latest fiscal year, up from A$18.1 million in 1994/1995, MIM said.  The Duisburg, Germany zinc and lead smelter recorded a reduced loss of A$11.1 million, which inlcuded aone-time retrenchment cost of A$4.9 million. Duisburg recorded a profit in the second half prior to the retrenchment cost, MIM said.MIM earlier reported a net profit after abnormals of A$170.6 million and a net profit before abnormals of A$29.8 million vs A$38 million a year earlier.The other partners in the McArthur River mine are Marubeni Corp, Mitsui Co Ltd, and Mitsubishi Materials Corp, each five percent and Nippon Mining and Metal Co Ltd, 15 percent.  -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800", "label": ["C152", "C15", "C24", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Palestinians planned to take their grievances to the negotiating table with Israel on Thursday following a four-hour general strike against Israeli policy on settlements and Jerusalem.A day after Yasser Arafat accused Israel of declaring war on the Palestinians, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a surprise announcement that two senior negotiatiors would meet at 1130 GMT in a Jerusalem hotel.Israeli army chief Dan Shomron and Palestinian Local Government Minister Saeb Erekat chair the Israeli-Palestinian Steering Committee that oversees implementation of the self-rule deals signed by Israel and the PLO.\"We hope this meeting will result in the immediate reciprocal implementation of...the agreements signed,\" Erekat told reporters. \"We hope very soon that words will be transferred to deeds.\"Shops and businesses shut for four hours across the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Israeli-annexed Arab East Jerusalem, in response to a strike call by Palestinian President Arafat.He condemned at a meeting of the Palestinian legislature on Wednesday the Netanyahu government's pledge to expand Jewish settlement and its insistence that East Jerusalem will remain forever under Israeli control.The PLO wants East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.The strike was the first in both the West Bank and Gaza since Israel handed parts of the areas to self-rule in 1994. Residents said the stoppage was widely observed but a Reuters photographer in Hebron said most shops in the city, still under Israeli guns, remained open.In a move likely to fuel further Palestinian anger, Israel disclosed more plans to build additional homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank.\"(Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai) approved a number of construction plans in existing settlements. These are building plans which had been approved in the past by the (Labour) government and later frozen,\" his spokesman Avi Benayahu said.Benayahu declined to say how many homes would be built. The Maariv newspaper put the number at 3,550. It said Israel would add 700 housing units to the settlement of Kiryat Sefer, 1,050 to Hashmonaim, 900 to a nearby Jewish seminary, 200 to Matityahu and 700 to Betar Ilit.All are just inside the West Bank, near Jerusalem.The Steering Committee talks are likely to focus on Israel's long-delayed troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron, where some 450 armed Jewish settlers live among more than 100,000 Arabs.Palestinians view the partial pullout as a litmus test of Netanyahu's pledges to pursue peace.Israel's former Labour government delayed the move after Moslem suicide bombers killed 59 people in the Jewish state in February and March.Netanyahu's government is studying a revised pullback plan prepared by Mordechai which is expected to outline a wider deployment of Israeli troops in the city to protect the settlers.Palestinians said they would not accept any changes.Commenting on the decision to build privately funded homes in settlements, former tourism minister Uzi Baram said: \"The (government's) provocation of the Palestinians is clear. It is playing with a powder keg that puts all of us in danger.\"Palestinian Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi said Palestinians were not interested in \"promises in the air\" from Israel.\"The real proof (of Israel's intentions) is in this decision to build thousands more housing units, to confiscate more land, to expand settlements and settlement activities,\" she told reporters.In Ramallah, Arafat held talks with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti on the peace process.", "label": ["E41", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GJOB", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

CBRS said the increasingly competitive Canadian telecommunications industry will likely result in future earnings volatility at BCE. The company's current investments include a blend of high yield and high growth telecommunications assets. Overall, CBRS expects to see further operational and financial improvements at BCE's operating units in 1996 and 1997.The company's earnings are expected to approach C$1 billion in 1996, and debt and interest coverage ratios will likely reverse their downward trend of the past few years and show modest improvements, CBRS said. -- Reuters Montreal bureau (514) 985-2434", "label": ["C17", "C174", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Doctors operated on Popov, 24, for three hours.Popov told NTV television on Sunday he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly. \"There's no need to worry. We're going to be walking soon -- and swimming,\" he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care unit.Interfax news agency said police had detained one of the attackers.

{"token": "Iraqi troops and tanks supporting a Kurdish rebel faction captured the city of Arbil in northern Iraq from a rival Kurdish force on Saturday, prompting President Bill Clinton to place U.S. forces in the region on high alert.Residents in Arbil reported heavy casualties from shelling and said terrified civilians were fleeing.\"My people on the ground confirm that Iraqi troops have entered Arbil at 3.45 p.m. (1145 GMT),\" said a U.N. official who declined to be named.He said a joint force of Iraqi troops and rebels from Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) had seized control of Arbil from forces of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and by evening there was only sporadic shooting.The Iraqi flag was flying above what used to be the Kurdish parliament building in Arbil, a U.N. official in Geneva said.Clinton, speaking at a stop on a campaign bus tour in the midwest, said the developments caused him \"grave concern\".\"I have placed our forces in the region on high alert and they are now being reinforced,\" he said.\"Early this morning the military forces of Iraq overran the city of Arbil which is in the portion of northern Iraq controlled and populated by the Kurds. The situation there remains unclear. There are reports of heavy fighting and firing in populated areas,\" Clinton told a crowd at the Tennessee town of Troy.\"It is premature at this time, and I want to emphasise that, highly premature to speculate on any response we might have,\" Clinton said.U.N. sources said about 12,000 Iraqi troops helped the KDP to capture Arbil, which had been a PUK stronghold since fighting between rival factions in the city in 1994 and used to have a population of some 800,000.There were unconfirmed reports that Iran had sent troops into northern Iraq in response to the Iraqi attack on Arbil.\"They entered this morning. They have occupied the area to the depth of 40 km (25 miles). They have established a headquarters in Chuman,\" Faik Nerweyi of the KDP told Reuters in Ankara.Chuman is on the main highway leading to Arbil from the Iranian border, some 90 km (55 miles) northeast of Arbil as the crow flies but further by the winding, mountainous road.Arbil lies about 20 km (12 miles) north of the 36th parallel -- the line that Iraqi forces have been barred by allied forces from crossing since the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.U.S., British and French warplanes are based in southern Turkey under Operation Provide Comfort to enforce a no-fly zone above the 36th parallel.PUK leader Jalal Talabani told Reuters by telephone from Arbil that he had warned Washington three days in advance that the Iraqi forces were prepared to attack Arbil.\"The Americans promised to attack them (the Iraqis). They did not act decisively,\" Talabani said.The British Broadcasting Corporation quoted Talabani as saying his forces were still resisting the Iraqi attack but that much of the city was under Iraqi control. There had been no mass exodus of civilians, he said.A senior administration official accompanying Clinton said the Iraqi troops surrounding Arbil consisted of three tank divisions of 30,000 to 40,000 Republican guard troops equipped with heavy artillery and surface-to-air missiles.He said it was the first such deployment by Iraq since shortly after the end of 1991 when President Saddam Hussein tried to seize control of northern Iraq, creating an exodus of some two million Kurdish refugees.Defence officials said at 1600 GMT that no U.S. forces had actually moved. But they said planning had been completed for the use, if ordered by Clinton, of the 200 U.S. warplanes in the region plus up to 40 others from the United States.They said 79 of the 200 fighter planes in the region were on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson and the rest were enforcing no-fly zones in both northern and southern Iraq, where they said flights have doubled.The two Kurdish factions, split along political and tribal lines, have a long history of bloodshed and shifting alliances with the main powers in the region -- Iraq and Iran.The Iraqi government in Baghdad said it had decided to \"provide support and military aid\" for the KDP in its fight against the PUK.In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA), Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said Iraq's military intervention was in response to a plea from Barzani to Saddam to back him against attacks by Iran and Talabani.The KDP has long sought to break the grip of the PUK over Arbil, the seat of a Kurdish government and parliament that was created jointly by the two factions in elections in 1992.The United States twice negotiated a ceasefire between the two rival Kurdish factions this month. But there were repeated violations. The two factions met at the U.S. embassy in London on Friday for talks to consolidate the ceasefire.", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady at its August policy meeting, U.S. economists now expect no rate change until after the November 5th Presidential election, according to the most recent Reuters poll.Only three of 29 economists surveyed on Tuesday called for a move at the upcoming September 24 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Both said the move would be a tightening.  A majority of the experts -- 16 of 29 -- forecast a tightening at the November 13 meeting in response to signs of increased inflation.\"We'll see a slight tightening after the election,\" said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Bank Corp.The central bank may see signs of increased wage inflation in upcoming economic reports, but none drastic enough for a rate hike at the next meeting, Hoffman said.He is expecting a gain of 200,000 new jobs in the August employment report, the next key data for monetary policymakers.  But the report \"would have to be a lot stronger than that\" to push the Fed into a September tightening, according to Hoffman.Michael Casey, international economist at MFR Inc, said the Federal Reserve would look closely at the manufacturing sector in the coming weeks.\"It's very vapory at this point,\" Casey said. \"If they saw something a little more solid there I think it would prompt them.\"  Nineteen economists forecast the Fed's next move would be a tightening. Five said the central bank was on hold for the foreseeable future. And two said they expect an interest rate cut.Two of the experts called for a change in rates in 1997 but did not specify whether interest rates would be raised or lowered.The current survey differed slightly from a poll conducted last Friday which had 12 of 30 economists predicting a November tightening.Full results of the survey follow.

{"token": "German private bank Gries & Heissel Bankiers on Wednesday launched an Internet banking service -- the first comprehensive service of its kind in a country where online bank options are gradually taking off.The small Berlin-based bank linked up with U.S. computer firm Hewlett Packard Co to develop the system, which Internet users can access using a high-security personal code.Clients will be able to view detailed balances on their deposit, current and securities accounts and transact all normal banking business on the World Wide Web.Although online banking is a developing trend on the German financial services market, larger banks with far broader customer bases are working on more selective Internet packages.Thomas Gries, one of Gries & Heissel's personally-liable directors, said he regarded Internet banking as a logical supplement to the bank's existing services.\"We have had an Internet home page since October 1995. This move from a pure information medium to an interactive one was a logical one,\" Gries said.Banking officials attending the CEBIT electronics conference in Hanover this week said German online banking business was poised to grow dramatically.\"In the next six months, five to ten German banks will be on the Internet,\" said Stefan Schoeller, board member at Bayerische Vereinsbank AG unit Vereins- und West Bank.Vereinsbank plans to launch Internet services within about six months via its Advance Bank direct unit, pending a review of security options.Rival discount broker Direkt Anlage Bank, a unit of Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel Bank AG, on Tuesday launched an Internet service for its securities account holders at half the cost of its telephone banking service.Meanwhile market leader Deutsche Bank AG is to test electronic cash on the Internet this autumn in a joint initiative with Dutch electronic payments group Digicash NV.Vereinsbank officials at CEBIT said they planned a steady expansion of the bank's online options over the coming years, predicting 10 to 15 percent of its current account clients would be online by the year 2000. Around 12 million Germans would rely on home banking by that date, the bank predicted.At the moment, around 3.7 percent of the bank's clients, or 45,000 individuals, handle their banking via PC alone, Stefan Schoeller said.Hewlett-Packard's German sales manager Michael Lindner said his company, which last year helped set up the world's first Internet bank, Security First Network Bank, had spoken to several other German banks about some kind of Internet venture.\"We certainly do not plan to limit our involvement to a small exclusive bank,\" he said.Lindner said there were about two million Internet users in Germany and 35 million worldwide. He admitted that the amount of bank business transacted on the Net -- about $200 million -- was \"very limited\" but predicted a dramatic rise in volume.Vereinsbank's Schoeller said the cost advantage alone made it worthwhile for customers to go online. A normal current account incurred charges of 8.40 marks a month, while the same account online would cost just 5.40 marks, he said.All banks are stressing the security of the Internet.", "label": ["C22", "C33", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Health authorities have so far failed to establish the carrier of the germ, which is easily transmitted from person to person.On Friday, the eleventh victim died in western Japan's Nara prefecture, dashing hopes that the epidemic was easing.The city of Sakai, near Osaka in western Japan, has been hit hardest by the epidemic, with nearly 6,500, mostly school children, affected.Health authorities believe school lunches are the source of the food poisoning in Sakai.The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation's school lunch programme.News of the woman's death came as Japanese media reported health officials were preparing to declare next month that the worst of the epidemic was over as the number of new infections had decreased.\"There are no new cases of infection and I hope we can make public a bright outlook,\" Health Minister Naoto Kan said earlier in the week.", "label": ["C12", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Cuts in mortgage interest rates that month might have helped sentiment but borrowers' bills would not have reflected the easing for a month or so.

{"token": "The outlook for German bond prices was decidedly unclear on Thursday after the Bundesbank evidently surprised the market with an 0.3 point cut in its key money market rate to an all-time low of three percent.The cut in the repo rate, well above forecasts for an easing of five to 10 basis points at best, left some players predicting that the rate-cut cycle had come to an end.No longer sustained by hopes for another easing, Bunds would soon succumb to profit-taking, they said.Others argued that the sharp fall in yields at the short end of the market in response to the Bundesbank's move could help propel Bunds beyond key resistance levels above 98.00.The low level of short-term debt yields made it cheaper to refinance purchases of Bunds and would thereby help push Bund yields lower, some dealers said.The entire German debt market firmed after the rate cut.By 1220 GMT, one-and-a-half hours after the Bundesbank's announcement flashed across traders' screens, September Bund futures on the DTB German futures exchange had risen as high as 98.03.That was up 60 basis points from Wednesday's close and about 50 basis points from their level before news.In the cash bond market, the benchmark 10-year 6.25 percent Bund yielded 6.28 percent at 1220 GMT, down roughly five basis points after the announcement.Five-year Bobl futures had risen as high as 103.17, up 59 basis points on the day and three-month September Euromarks had risen as high as 96.86 on the London International Financial Futures Exchange, or Liffe, up 18 basis points.Forecasts for the outlook of German debt varied.\"This is the end of German rate cut hopes,\" said Markus Herrmann, bond analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Frankfurt.Another cut in the 2.50 percent discount rate -- the floor to money market rates -- was relatively unlikely and the scope for another repo easing was slim, barring unforeseen developments, Herrmann said.\"We're going to see profit-taking, particularly at the long end.\"But Heinz Gunasekera, bond analyst at UBS in Frankfurt, said he remained positive for Bunds.\"If the market finds its feet at this level and pushes towards 98.00, people who missed the last rally will jump in, Gunasekera said. \"I'm pretty bullish, I didn't expect them to cut by that much. The market is holding up very well.\"Gunasekera predicted trading would become more technical, and that a breach of key resistance at 98.22 would pave the way for gains as high as 98.75.Gunasekera predicted the yield on 10-year government bonds would rise to between 6.40 and 6.50 percent by end-1996.\"What matters now is how foreign investors react,\" one Frankfurt-based bond dealer said. \"The refinancing is ideal but where should expectations for another rate cut come from?\"Another dealer saw Bunds becoming even more dependent on movements in U.S. bonds.\"The long end will certainly remain attached to the navel of the U.S.,\" the trader said.--Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525", "label": ["M12", "M131", "M13", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "By Rich Miller, Economics CorrespondentU.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin seemed a bit taken aback on Tuesday by the rousing welcome he received at a breakfast meeting of the Florida delegation to the Democratic Party convention. But he did not let it faze him.Rubin, a self-effacing millionaire who spent much of his career out of the political limelight, steadfastly set out the reasons why President Clinton deserves a second term.The president, Rubin told the applauding delegates, had the \"guts\" to take the tough decisions needed to slash the federal budget deficit. He lambasted Republican presidential challenger Bob Dole's tax-cutting plan, charging it would balloon the deficit, push up interest rates and hurt the economy.A former investment banker who spent 26 years on Wall Street, Rubin is a man who seems more comfortable plotting international monetary strategy behind closed doors than giving a public speech aimed at pumping up the party faithful.The Treasury chief acknowledged there was a difference between the two -- his fellow finance ministers do not applaud his performance at meetings of rich industrial nations.Rubin's low-key style won the admiration of at least one delegate from Florida, a state where the New York-born Treasury chief spent most of his youth.\"Rubin is good,\" said Vivian Biagini, who has watched Rubin's televised appearances before Congress. \"He always manages to stay cool.\"Rubin, 58, is no stranger to politics. He has been active in raising funds for the Democrats for more than two decades and was head of the host committee at the party's 1992 convention in New York.Sometimes his political sense serves him well, but not always.He won laughter from Florida delegates when he quipped, \"I don't know why the right-hand microphone is better than the left-hand microphone. But I'm going to speak from the center.\"But when he tried to repeat that success before the arguably more liberal New York delegation, the joke fell flat.Rubin gently warned both delegations not to become complacent -- Clinton is comfortably ahead of Dole in the opinion polls -- and to keep working hard in the run-up to the November 5 election.For his part, the Treasury chief did not seem truly energized until after he left the delegation meetings and attended a policy forum to discuss ways to help the inner cities.Known for his compassion for the poor as well as his grasp of high finance, Rubin has been a strong voice within the administration on the need to tackle America's social ills, especially those of its inner cities.The Treasury chief has shied away from saying whether he plans to stay on the job if Clinton wins in November, although administration insiders are betting that he would.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GPRO", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "By Tony Hawkins, Professor of Business Studies, University of ZimbabweWith consumer inflation slowing half a point in July to 22 percent - its lowest level in a year - market analysts seem satisfied that, at last, Zimbabwe's inflation cycle has turned.Since breaking through the 20-percent barrier in 1991, inflation in Zimbabwe has averaged 27 percent and has been stuck around 22 percent for the last three years.But not everyone shares the market's \"conventional wisdom\" of markedly lower inflation in the latter half of 1996 and into next year. Indeed, it is increasingly difficult to understand why market analysts are so upbeat in their inflation forecasts.The slowdown from recent peaks of 28 percent in January to July's 22 percent is explained chiefly by the excellent harvest and the fall in some food prices, the increasingly overvalued Zimbabwe dollar exchange rate, which has kept the lid on import prices, and high levels of competition in the domestic market, which have prevented firms from passing on cost increases as liberally as they would have liked.Until last year, too, average real wages were falling, also contributing to greater price stability.With the favourable food price effect beginning to lose momentum, the Zimbabwe dollar set for a substantial downward adjustment and the government seemingly committed to inflationary import tarrif hikes - to counter what Zimbabwean industrialists call South African dumping - the three main influences making for lower inflation are likely to be reversed over the next six to nine months.Add to that, the spate of wage awards well above the inflation rate and continued excessive money supply growth in the first half of 1996, and the inflation outlook looks increasingly bleak.The July budget adopted a benign neglect stance towards inflation and the country's worsening debt-trap situation. No corrective measures were taken to curb money supply growth, and the projected budget deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP in 1996/97 will maintain upward pressures on prices over the next year.The latest money supply numbers make depressing reading too. In the first half of the year, the monetary aggregates grew at annual rates ranging from 25 percent to 48 percent, well above the official target of 18 percent to 22 percent.However, that is only part of the story. This excessive monetary expansion occurred despite a huge - and increasingly unsustainable - sterilization campaign by the central bank.By July, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe's Treasury bill issue had grown to over Z$22 billion (US$220 million) from Z$6.5 billion a year earlier.Indeed, government's floating debt of \"ordinary\" and \"special\" Treasury bills now approximates 35 percent of GDP, costing the taxpayer some Z$5.3 billion a year (about eight percent of GDP) in interest charges. Some of the more thoughtful analysts are asking how much longer this balancing act of mopping up Z$1 billion and more in special Treasury bills each month can continue.When he delivers his half-yearly monetary policy statement in the next few weeks, RBZ governor Leonard Tsumba may give some clues, unlike his boss, Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa, who sidestepped the whole problem in his budget speech last month.Not that Dr Tsumba has any great room to manoeuvre. He is locked into a policy cul-de-sac from which there is no easy escape. If he listens to the increasingly shrill demands of the industrial lobby to cut interest rates, credit growth will take off thereby ensuring that the downturn in inflation is shortlived. If he continues to expand the Treasury bill mountain at the current rate of Z$1 billion a month, he may delay the inevitable monetary explosion for a while yet, but only at an enormously heavy cost to the taxpayer.To compound his problems the Zimbabwe dollar continues to appreciate in the foreign exchange market. In the first seven months of 1996, the Zimbabwe currency has appreciated some 15 percent against that of its main trading partner, the South African rand. With a gap of some 15 percent between Zimbabwe's 22 percent and South Africa's seven percent inflation rates, the real appreciation of Zimbabew's dollar - against an admittedly weak and probably undervalued rand - is running close to 30 percent. Against all currencies, the Zimbabwe unit is up some 10 percent to 12 percent in real terms over the past year.With agricultural exports, especiallly tobacco, in boom mode and some of the main mineral exports also doing well, there is no great pressure on the balance of payments, especially since high real interest rates have constrained import and investment demand. But tourism is beginning to hurt, while mining companies are reporting unit cost increases of between 17 and 22 percent that are squeezing their margins.Industrialists continue to clamour for anti-dumping measures against South Africa, seemingly unperturbed by the much more potent threat of low-cost competition from the Asian Rim and the need to reduce their dependence on domestic market sales. Indeed, the contrast between their vehement demands for tariff restructuring (a euphemism for greater protection) and their silence on exchange rate overvaluation is striking. It confirms that Zimbabwe has some way to go before the culture of export-led growth takes root amongst its industrial community.Sooner rather than later the problems of the Treasury bill mountain, the monetary bubble, the liquidity overhang and the overvalued exchange rate will have to be resolved. It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the resolution is going to be both painful and inflationary.The more protracted the strategy of  benign neglect the nastier the eventual monetary crunch will be when it comes.\t\t\t\t  / / / / / / /(The opinions expressed in this article represent those of the author only.

{"token": "Wall Street stocks fell sharply on slim volume Friday after some surprisingly strong economic numbers undermined bonds and raised fears of higher interest rates.At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 55.48 points at 5,592.17. The Dow had plunged 64.73 points to 5,647.65 Thursday, after being down nearly 90 points.In the broader market, losing issues outpaced gainers by about 14 to 6 on sluggish volume of 168 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.The Nasdaq Composite index lost 3.58 points to 1,141.45.In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1-3/32, or $10.94 on a $1,000 bond, raising its yield to 7.13 percent from 7.04 percent at Thursday's close.Analysts said the unexpectedly strong economic data reinforced fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to head off inflation as the economy continues to move ahead strongly.The most important bit of data was the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, a precursor to next week's National Association of Purchasing Management report.The Chicago index jumped to a suprising 60.0 in August from 51.2 in July. A 51.9 reading had been expected.\"That is the report that more than any other was responsible for the sell-off in stocks and bonds,\" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.\"It hints that manufacturing activity was strong throughout the country and that will be reflected in next Tuesday's National Association of Purchasing Management figures and Friday's employment numbers.\"What the Chicago PMI tells you is to get ready for some unfriendly numbers next week.\"To add insult to injury, the University of Michigan consumer confidence index for August rose to 95.3 from July's final reading of 94.7.Slim volume and the fact that the numbers were a surprise to Wall Street exaggerated the reaction, said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co.\"A lot of participants are not active, so you get exaggerated moves,\" he said.\"The most significant factor is that all this is a surprise. The consensus had been for a significant slowdown in the economy, which would forestall an increase in interest rates.\"The Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is expected to rule on rates when it meets Sept. 24.\"This was supposed to be a good day,\" Johnson said. \"The last three days before Labour Day have been strong for the last 17 years.\" The market will be closed Monday for Labour Day.Among the day's special situations, Boatmen's Bancshares jumped 10-13/16 to 53-3/4 and topped the Nasdaq market's most active list on news it will be acquired by NationsBank Corp.NationsBank was down 7-1/4 at 85-1/8 in active trading on the NYSE.Dell Computer was up one at 67-5/9 on news that it would replace Varity Corp. in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index after the close of trading Sept. 5.", "label": ["M11", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Belief that Japan will keep its easy money policy on hold has dulled market interest in a key central bank survey due out next week, but some are keen to see whether the Bank of Japan can prevent leaks of sensitive data.Most economists expect the central bank's quarterly corporate survey, or \"tankan\", to show some improvement in business sentiment when the data is unveiled next Wednesday.But few anticipate the survey will contain data stunning enough to prompt the central bank to boost interest rates, which it has kept at record low levels for nearly a year.Most economists surveyed by Reuters forecast that the diffusion index for big manufacturers, an important gauge of corporate sentiment, would rise somewhat from the minus three posted in May, when the last survey was conducted.Private forecasts ranged from minus four to plus five, with seven out of 15 think-tanks predicting that the index would slip into positive territory for the first time since November 1991. The firms themselves forecast an August index of zero when they were surveyed in May.The index represents the percentage of firms expecting business to improve minus those who expect it to worsen. The higher the number, the more optimistic the outlook.\"The data is unlikely to show a sharp improvement,\" said Jesper Koll, chief economist at JP Morgan in Tokyo. \"It will show a modest improvement.\"Major non-manufacturers' are also expected to have grown less gloomy than in May, when their diffusion index was at minus nine. Private forecasts ranged from minus 10 to plus one, but only one out of 13 think-tanks forecast a positive figure.Companies forecast an August index of minus three in May. Capital spending plans for the fiscal year to March 31, 1997, are expected to be about the same as the six percent rise companies said they planned in May.Economists said such modest data was unlikely to prompt the Bank of Japan to move soon to tighten short-term market rates or boost the official discount rate at which it lends to commercial banks. Many think there will be no change this year, although some argue the central bank could nudge up short-term market rates before the year's end.\"Interest rate policy is on hold,\" Koll said.Such expectations contrast sharply with rampant market speculation as recently as last month that the central bank was poised to raise rates.Economists say fears that Japan's economic recovery will falter later this year when public spending peters out and take another hit when the three percent sales tax is raised to five percent from April 1 are reinforcing central bank caution.While the tankan's content is expected to be something of a damp squib, some analysts are watching for signs that the data has been leaked, as many believe it has been in the past.The Bank of Japan said late last month that it would release the data in August, the same month the survey was conducted, rather than in early September as has been past practice.The central bank will also unveil the key figures in the survey at 11 a.m. local time (0200 GMT) rather than 2 p.m. (0500 GMT) as had been the custom. More complete details will be released a day later, also at 11 a.m.BOJ officials said the change was aimed at making the data available as soon as possible and allowing the market to digest it during trading hours on the same day. The release of other economic indicators has also recently been brought forward.They flatly denied that the new schedule was related to rumours that \"tankan\" figures have been leaked in the past.BOJ officials from Governor Yasuo Matsushita on down have said they did not believe rumours that May tankan data was leaked ahead of its official release at 2 p.m. on June 7. That morning, rumours swirled that the diffusion index for manufacturers would be minus three for May and zero for August -- precisely what the figures turned out to be.Some analysts remain unconvinced by the official denials of leaks. \"The truth is, the data has been leaked the past three times,\" said one economist, who declined to be identified.\"So they are trying to shorten the time between compilation and the actual release. It will be interesting to see if they can really control the leaking. If not, it could raise a credibility issue,\" the economist said.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

When floor trading by open outcry finally began three hours later, stock prices soared.Within minutes, the IPC index peaked at 3,432.13 points, setting a new intraday high, before gradually winding down in the afternoon.While the Mexican bolsa was shut down, the Dow Jones industrial average was tumbling into negative territory and the peso, vulnerable because of sharply lower interest rates from Tuesday's primary Mexican Treasury bill auction, started losing ground on the dollar.But the peso held firm, and market leader Telmex's ADRs charged forward, effectively coming to the bolsa's rescue, traders said.Telmex ADRs closed 3/4 higher to 34-1/8.

In all 11 sites will be searched in coming days.Searches for bodies and clues have focused on teenagers An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks, whom Dutroux, 39, has admitted kidnapping a year ago. Their fate remains unknown although police have expressed some hope they are still alive.The nation went into shock on August 17 as Dutroux led police to the bodies of eight-year-old friends Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune in the garden of another house he owns. Dutroux's accomplice Bernard Weinstein, whom he admitted killing, was buried nearby.Two other girls, Laetitia Delhez, 14, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, were rescued on August 15 from a makeshift dungeon in another of the houses Dutroux owns.Described as cold and manipulative, Dutroux was released 10 years early in 1992 for good behaviour from a 13-year sentence for multiple child rape, violence and illegal imprisonment.Dutroux, a father of three, and an associate Michel Lelievre have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment.The lawyer who defended Dutroux in 1989 on the rape charges has refused to do so again on moral grounds.Britain's Superintendent John Bennett who supervised excavations in the Fred and Rosemary West serial murder case in England two years ago, was present at Jumet on Wednesday.There were also fresh searches at other sites including the house in Sars-La-Buissiere where Melissa and Julie were hidden.Dutroux said the girls, who disappeared in June 1995, starved to death early this year, He denies killing them but admits paying accomplices 40,000 francs ($1,300) to kidnap them.They were buried in the city of Liege a week ago after what amounted to a state funeral amid outpourings of grief and anger.As the searches continued in Belgium, Dutroux was named in Bratislava as a suspect in the murder of a young Slovak woman. The Slovak office of Interpol said he was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one other Slovak woman.So far 10 people have been arrested in what has now become known as the \"Dutroux Affair\", including Dutroux' second wife Michelle Martin, who has been charged as an accomplice.Martin and Lelievre were interrogated again on Wednesday.There has been widespread anger over revelations of police bungling, and the Justice Ministry has ordered an inquiry. A chief police detective has also been arrested on fraud charges, fuelling questions about a possible high-level cover-up.There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux, an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support, managed to own six houses.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Russia's new energy minister, Pyotr Rodionov, has gained a reputation as a hard man during a long career working for natural gas monopoly Gazprom.\"He's been described as fairly tough,\" said MC Securities oil and gas analyst Stephen O'Sullivan. \"He clearly comes from the gas industry -- no one in the oil industry seems to know him.\"President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree naming Rodionov as the new minister of fuel and energy, Russian news agencies on Thursday quoted the president's press service as saying.Rodionov is currently a board member of RAO Gazprom and managing director of its St Petersburg subsidiary, Lentransgaz.Lentransgaz last August reduced supplies to St Petersburg consumers who were behind on payment, Interfax news agency said, although it was not clear if Rodionov was responsible for the decision.The 45-year-old engineer has worked at Lentransgaz practically all his adult life, was appointed to the Gazprom board in May and will work again for his former boss at Gazprom, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.Rodionov, as chief executive of AO Lentransgaz, criticised the neighboring Baltic states last October for considering using Norwegian natural gas instead of Russian gas, calling it an uneconomical move, the Russian daily Sevodnya wrote.\"It is interesting that he said it was economically unreasonable rather than unacceptable,\" O'Sullivan said.But whether the ministry of fuel and energy will have significant influence under Rodionov is unclear.\"The ministry of fuel and energy essentially does not have anything to do,\" a government source told Reuters recently.Privatisation of the oil industry, the independence of Gazprom and the transfer of oil transport issue decisions to the federal energy commission have reduced the role of the ministry, the source said.Former energy minister Yuri Shafranik may have chosen to run for political office rather than serve a second term as energy minister, the source added.But O'Sullivan said Rodionov could play an important role in regulating the electricity industry, which is heavily dependent on natural gas.\"The ministry could influence whether there is much competition in the industry... Changes in gas tariffs affect electricity rates,\" he said.Unified Energy System (UES), the national grid controller and major shareholder in all but one of Russia's local power companies, is a mini-ministry of its own with strong lobbying powers in Rodionov's new ministry.Battling UES's appetite for control could be one of Rodionov's biggest jobs, if he decides to pursue it.The fuel and energy ministry will play a role in oil and natural gas tariffs but the extent of the powers of Rodionov and his ministry is unclear and could depend in large part on Rodionov's former boss -- Chernomyrdin.", "label": ["C13", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Frankenberg resigned Thursday after slightly more than two years at the helm of the struggling computer network software company.Novell said John Young, former president and chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard Co., would replace Frankenberg as chairman, and the company said it had begun a search for a new chief executive.Novell's executive vice president of worldwide sales, Joseph Marengi, was promoted to president, a post that Frankenberg had also held.Frankenberg, a former Hewlett-Packard executive recruited in April 1994 to succeed the Orem, Utah-based company's longtime chief, Ray Noorda, struggled to reinvent Novell as industry leader Microsoft Corp. fiercely attacked its core business.At the same time he was forced to dispose of businesses, including the WordPerfect Corp. word-processing unit and DR-DOS operating system that he inherited from Noorda, who had acquired the operations in a seemingly obsessive drive to compete with Microsoft and its chairman, Bill Gates.Frankenberg was widely liked but was unable to articulate a strategy that could satisfy Novell customers, analysts said.\"The sad thing is this guy Frankenberg was very qualified, and it makes you wonder 'If he can't do it, who can?'\" said one software industry analyst.Novell had performed erratically under Frankenberg, posting lower earnings in six of the nine quarters during which he ran the company.One informal industry survey done by an independent consultant in recent weeks found more than three-fourths of respondents expressed doubt about whether Frankenberg could turn the company around.Nevertheless, David Coursey, publisher and editor of the new online newsletter Coursey.Com, noted that the company has doggedly held onto the major portion of its market share in networking software despite the challenge from Microsoft's high-end Windows NT system.\"You're still talking about a company with a worldwide market share of over 60 percent,\" Coursey said. \"You can't kill a company that has that much going for it in a year.\"But, Novell needed to avoid the downward spiral known in the industry as \"The Wang Factor,\" named for the sharp 1980s downfall of Wang Laboratories, which once dominated word processing applications.In a teleconference, Marengi acknowledged Novell's problems but expressed confidence they could be solved.\"It's been a very tough time for the last year and a half,\" Marengi said. \"We have a real situation that we need to turn around and it can be turned around very quickly.\"He said more aggressive marketing was one key to success. \"We've been relatively passive in the past few years and that's something that we're going to change over the next few months.\"Analysts said Novell faces many challenges in months ahead.\"It's a difficult situation. Life does not get immediately better just because Frankenberg's gone,\" Coursey said. \"They've always done their best by being where Microsoft isn't; they just haven't figured out where that's going to be.\"Novell's recent push has been to accelerate its support for the Internet and corporate internal networks based on that technology, known as Intranets, a market that could attract customers who use its network software.\"I think it's too early to write Novell off,\" Coursey added. \"The industry tends to overreact to both good and bad news.\"Novell's stock fell 62.5 cents to $10.375 on Nasdaq.Young, 64, was president and chief executive of Hewlett-Packard for 15 years through 1992.

{"token": "Russian Security supremo Alexander Lebed pushed ahead with a ceasefire plan in rebel Chechnya on Friday, but the absence of public approval from President Boris Yeltsin raised questions about Kremlin support for him.The ambitious reserve general, whose political career could depend on success in Chechnya, said he would meet the president on Friday to discuss a peace plan negotiated in Chechnya on Thursday. But Yeltsin's office said no meeting was planned.Hours before Lebed struck the deal in Chechnya, Yeltsin criticised him for acting too slowly to end the 20-month war. He has since made no comment on the truce, which began at noon (0800GMT).Grozny was relatively calm on Friday and both Russian soldiers and Chechen fighters said the ceasefire was holding.\"Preparations are going on now for the withdrawal of units from southern districts of the republic to the Chechen plain,\" Interfax quoted the Russian command in Chechnya as saying.Lebed, a reserve paratroop general appointed by Yeltsin last week to settle the conflict, said he had been given full command of operations there and would meet Yeltsin in the afternoon.\"I'm in command here. I have legitimate authority to fulfil the duties I have been charged with,\" Interfax news agency quoted him as saying on his return to Moscow early on Friday.But Lebed's powers have never been clearly defined in public and the chain of command has been tangled in recent days.It will take tough words from Yeltsin to convince Russia's military hawks, humiliated by the rebels' seizure of the Chechen capital Grozny this month, they should give Lebed a chance.The signs are not encouraging so far.The head of Russia's North Caucasus military district, which includes Chechnya, noted ceasefires have come and gone before.Yeltsin said of Lebed on Thursday: \"He always promised to solve the Chechnya problem if he had power. Now he has power. But unfortunately the results of his work are not yet obvious.\"\"But we will not despair. We will take the issue to the end,\" he added.Izvestia newspaper said the criticism raised serious questions and hinted that the president was out of touch.\"Either the president is still demanding the impossible -- the restoration of legal order in Chechnya as it was on August 5,\" it said, referring to the day before rebels seized Grozny.\"Or he is judging the activities of his security adviser on the basis of the siuation before Lebed's last trip to Chechnya.\"Both the United States and the European Community have already welcomed the ceasefire agreements.\"We welcome this agreement... We look forward to its implementation by both of the parties and hope it leads eventually to a political settlement to the Chechen crisis,\" U.S. State Department spokesman Glyn Davies said.Lebed, then commander of the 14th Russian Army, made his name as a peacemaker in Moldova's breakaway Dnestr region in 1992. He was named Yeltsin's security adviser as a vote-winning move between the two rounds of the presidential election.Lebed had captured 15 percent of the first-round vote, taking third place behind Yeltsin and the communist runner-up.Yeltsin virtually disappeared from sight soon after the first round, prompting speculation that he was ill.Aides denied all the rumours and press spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told Izvestia the president was \"lively and dynamic\" on Thursday after a two-day break.Komsomolskaya Pravda said Yeltsin had gone fishing and boating and played billiards during his short vacation.Yeltsin completed his new government line-up late on Thursday, naming Yevgeny Sidorov as minister for culture.The team includes one communist minister -- Aman Tuleyev, responsible for ties with the Commonwealth of Independent States. \"For the first time in the last five years a communist, rather than a former one, has appeared in the Russian government,\" Pravda-5 newspaper wrote on Friday.Both Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin were Communist Party members.

{"token": "Russia, buoyed by an International Monetary Fund decision to pay a delayed tranche of a $10 billion loan, could be set for its first inflation-free month since reforms began but economists say the budget is still a problem.Consumer prices fell 0.1 percent in the week to August 19 -- the first weekly fall since economic reform began in 1992 -- and the state statistics committee said prices could be flat for the month if current trends continue.On current trends, annual inflation could be as low as 16 percent, after 131 percent in 1995, it said. Inflation fell to its sixth consecutive monthly low of 0.7 percent in July.\"The main factor is the decline of inflationary expectations and that is very unusual taking the political situation in Russia into account,\" said Sergei Pavlenko, head of the government's working centre for economic reform.Economists have been disconcerted about several factors affecting the Russian economy in recent weeks -- President Boris Yeltsin's health, the costly war in Chechnya and the IMF decision to delay the loan.But Yeltsin reappeared on Thursday after a short gap, peace seemed a tiny step closer in Chechnya and the IMF paid up on the July tranche of its $10.2 billion three-year loan.Leading Russian shares and Russian debt prices rose.\"The $330 million means nothing, but what is important is that all flows of money between Russia and the West are related to the IMF,\" said Troika-Dialog chief economist Pavel Teplukhin.IMF backing was needed for Russia to seal its debt deals with the London and Paris Clubs and to win a rating for its planned Eurobond issue, he said.The IMF had delayed payment of the tranche, due in July, over concern about Russia's yawning budget deficit.\"The IMF has satisfied itself that the government is addressing the problem but they will want to assure themselves that the momentum is maintained because if it isn't the revenue will not be forthcoming,\" said one economist.The budget gap widened in the first half of this year, largely due to the high cost of heavy government borrowing during the presidential election campaign.Ministers have said boosting budget revenue and improving tax collection will be a key task in the rest of this year.Russian officials had said some of the performance targets agreed with the Fund would have to be relaxed.One economist said some targets had been modified slightly but added, \"The targets for the remainder of the year are consistent with keeping inflation down at this very low level.\"Apart from seeking to boost revenue, the government also plans to cut expenditure and has agreed to scrap tax exemptions.Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has said the battle with inflation is nearly over and has pledged to go for growth to boost living standards.But Teplukhin said the government would first have to cut interest rates to attract investors to the real economy.\"It is a trade-off between low inflation and low economic activity on the one hand and the high cost of government borrowing and of servicing domestic debt on the other,\" he said.The government has said it wants to cut rates on government securities and that it hopes its recent cautious opening of the market to foreigners will help achieve this aim.But the central bank said foreign investors bid just $100 million, against a permitted total of more than $600 million, at two Treasury bill auctions on Wednesday. Yields for foreigners are capped at 19 percent. The average yield for Russians was 74.16 percent on six-month paper.Teplukhin said foreigners should be offered exactly the same terms as domestic investors in the market.", "label": ["E131", "E13", "E51", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Union members at the idled Tosco Corp refinery in Trainer, Pa., are expected to ratify a tentative six-year collective bargaining pact in a Friday vote, union leadership said.\"We expect it to pass,\" said an official of local 8-234 of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers. More than 300 union members are to vote in the all-day poll. Results will be released late Friday evening, officials said.  Ratification would enable Tosco to push forward with its plan to run the 172,000 barrels-per-day refinery with 100 fewer union staff, as part of a modernization and streamlining program the company deems necessary to make a profit.Local OCAW members have been out of work since late January, when Tosco shut down the refinery after purchasing the plant as part of a $60 million deal with British Petroleum Co Plc.As part of the deal, Tosco also gained BP's 500-station East Coast retail network. The deal was announced in November, 1995, and finalized in the first days of February.  Tosco mothballed the Trainer refinery--formerly known as Marcus Hook--after assuming control, saying it could not make money under existing labor and operational conditions, and demanded changes in staffing and work rules.At that time, OCAW members rejected Tosco's attempt to cut jobs and hire workers on a non-seniority basis.In July, Tosco received the results of a study by the Bechtel Corp, which said the refinery could be run profitably with necessary labor and operations changes.  Part of the plan resulted in Tosco's plan to increase profits by reducing throughput to 150,000 bpd, upping the production of high-value clean-burning gasolines while reducing the slate of heavier fuel oils.Union members are now seen begrudgingly accepting the job cuts, and staffing plans, realizing the plant may never open otherwise.Tosco recently offered 216 union members jobs, choosing from a pool of the former BP union employees. The selection process paid no heed to seniority, Denis Stephano, president of local 8-234 said.  \"There are a lot of unhappy people around here on how this process has taken place. It's hard to see friends not offered jobs,\" Stephano said.Once the vote is tallied, the OCAW will notify Tosco of the results and if ratified, the company and union will meet in the next two weeks to set schedules for bringing workers back to the job.Tosco plans to invest $110 million in the plant, including $50 million to modernize operations. If all goes to schedule, the refinery will be back on-line in the summer of 1997, Tosco officials have said.  The total workforce at Trainer will include more than 100 non-union staff, bringing the total workforce to 360, compared with the 520 jobs when BP owned the refinery.-New York Energy Desk, +1 212 859 1828", "label": ["C24", "C42", "CCAT", "E41", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GJOB"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The German Bundesbank announced a larger than expected cut in its main money market interest rate on Thursday, boosting the U.S. dollar and triggering interest rate cuts in other European countries.The central bank said after its regular council meeting it was cutting its securities repurchase rate, or repo, to three percent, a historic low, from 3.30 percent.Its official discount and Lombard rates -- the floor and ceiling for German money market rates were held steady at he 2.50 percent and 4.50 percent respectively, in line with economists' expectations.Market speculation in advance of the meeting had centred on the repo rate, which the Bundesbank has held steady since February, despite lowering its official rates in mid-April.Other European central banks, keen to cut credit costs to boost economic growth, quickly followed the Bundesbank's lead.The Bank of France responded by immediately cutting its intervention rate to 3.35 percent from 3.55 percent.Belgium cut its central rate to three percent from 3.00 percent and Austria reduced its Gomex rate to 3.30 percent from 3.4 percent and its repo to three percent from 3.30 percent.The Bundesbank gave no explanation of its decision in an initial statement made after the council meeting.But economists said a slowdown in M3 money supply growth -- its leading monetary policy indicator -- to an annualised 8.6 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June had probably tipped the balance in favour of a cut.The move came despite data released this week which shows that the German economic recovery is on a stronger footing that many economists had thought.Financial markets' attention had been riveted on the outcome, with many players saying the Bundesbank had to act to avert an outbreak of tension in currency markets.Four weeks ago, markets were thrown into confusion when the Bundesbank failed to deliver a repo easing although comments from several senior central bank officials had made clear in advance that financial markets should be prepared for a move.The result was a renewed fall in the U.S. dollar and a series of attacks on the French franc, driven by market worries that the Bundesbank was trying to do its utmost to undermine European monetary union by braking European economic growth.Solid economic growth would help European governments to rein in their budget deficits, the main barrier most countries face in qualifying to join the single European currency.Hopes for an easing had dwindled on Wednesday and Thursday, after fresh economic statistics indicated that the economy was in better shape than many had thought, removing one basic argument in favour of easing monetary policy.A Reuter survey showed seven of 10 economists polled believed the Ifo institute business climate index, which on Wednesday jumped to an eight-month high of 94.1 in July, had decreased the chance for a repo rate cut at the meeting.A poll of the economists before the Ifo data showed 8 of 10 economists expected a rate cut of five to 20 basis points.Economists were surprised by the size of the move.Uwe Angenendt at BHF Bank in Frankfurt said, \"We had not expected such a large step. This is positive news for the dollar. I see a strengthening of the dollar against the mark on this news.\"He added, \"It is difficult to say whether this will be the end of rate cuts in this cycle. We see a strengthening of the economy, and against that background it could be an end to this cycle. But we have to wait for more data.\"But Stefan Schneider, Senior Economist at Paribas Capital Markets in Frankfurt said he believed German rates could now have bottomed.", "label": ["E12", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

It is a necessary requirement to allow Denmark to begin paying off its large public debt,\" Jelved said in an update of forecasts last issued in May.Her ministry, basing its calculations on current economic conditions, said it expected a public sector deficit of 15.3 billion crowns at the end of 1996, compared with its previous May 1996 prediction of a 12.0 billion crown shortfall.But it cut its 1997 forecast from 9.1 billion crowns to 5.8 billion. \"The general tone...is slightly more optimistic,\" the survey said of the forecasts as a whole.Other forecasts for both 1996 and 1997 presented the economy doing better than previously expected.They saw unemployment, a major drain on public coffers in Denmark's lavish welfare state, at 9.0 percent by the end of 1996, compared with May projections of 9.2 percent.The survey saw 8.6 percent jobless at the end of 1997, compared to a previous forecast of 8.7 percent.In June 1996 actual Danish unemployment was 8.7 percent on a year-to-year basis, against 1995's average 10.3 percent.The ministry also trimmed its 1996 inflation estimate to 2.0 percent from its previous estimate of 2.1 percent.It said that it now expected 2.3 percent inflation in 1997, compared to earlier estimates of 2.4 percent.The most bullish expectations were for the current account, now seen enjoying a 10 billion crown surplus in 1996, rising to 11.5 billion in 1997, compared to previous estimates of 8.3 billion and 10 billion.The independent Economic Council -- known as the Wise Men -- last May predicted a 1997 current account surplus of 10.9 billion crowns, but warned that it would plummet to 1.8 billion the following year.The economy ministry forecast is limited to 1996 and 1997.The only forecast left unchanged was that for gross domestic product (GDP) growth, still expected to be 1.8 percent in 1996 and 3.0 percent in 1997.\"These rates are slightly above expectations of growth in neighbouring countries, mainly due to the contribution from increased oil and gas production in the North Sea,\" the survey said.--Copenhagen newsroom +45 33969650", "label": ["E11", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "British retail sales suffered a surprise 0.6 percent drop in July, official figures showed on Wednesday, providing evidence that while high streets shops are busy there is no danger of a runaway spending boom.The news was immediately welcomed by the government which is enjoying a sustained economic upturn with no sign of inflation, and raised the possibility of yet another interest rate cut.The dip in July followed a bumper 1.4 percent rise in June, the Office for National Statistics said, taking the year-on-year growth rate to 2.2 percent.Economists said the data showed British shoppers are clearly feeling the benefit of cheaper borrowing costs, tax cuts and rising incomes after years of tough pay restraint.The Treasury said sales were \"on an upward trend\", but the figures confounded City economists who had expected a small rise.\"The figures will help to ease fears of a return to a 1980s -style consumer boom and will provide useful ammunition for Chancellor Clarke in the interest rate rebate,\" said Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC Markets.The data will also help the government cut the cost of borrowing again in the run up to the general election, due to be held by next May.British voters are particularly sensitive to the cost of borrowing as two-thirds of households own their homes.The government is eager to restore a strong sense of national wellbeing, or the \"feel-good factor', and knows one more rate cut will give the economy an extra push.Recent data has shown the government is leading a charmed existence with house prices and consumer spending on the up, but inflationary pressures domant.High spending on expensive household items in particular, up 3.8 percent in the year to July, suggested voters are feeling more confident about the future, largely thanks to higher real incomes as tax and interest rate cuts hit home.However, the ruling Conservatives are still trailing opposition Labour by over 20 points in the opinion polls and Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke may be under pressure to cut rates one more time.If he does, he risks a full blown argument with the central bank. The two men clashed in June when rates were cut by a quarter-point to 5.75 percent, with the Bank warning that strong consumer spending may mean inflation picks up next year.Some analysts said a rate cut on the back of one month's fall in shop sales would be a risky strategy and Clarke could come under pressure for a politically-unpopular rate rise before the election.\"We are inclined to view the monthly drop in retail sales as an aberration,\" said Alex Garrard, UK economist at UBS.\"The drop reflects a rebound from the extraordinary high level of retail activity in June which was somewhat artificially boosted by a weather-related jump in clothing and footwear sales and spending of overseas visitors here to watch the Euro 96 Football Championships.\"And consumer spending will receive another boost if, as expected, the government cuts income tax again in the November budget, the last chance it has to prove its tax-cutting credentials before the polls.This, on top of more cash handouts from building societies turning into banks, would mean disposable income will continue climbing next year.", "label": ["E11", "E143", "E14", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

But the document did not say whether Chechnya's secession would be negotiated among other options.The document also provided for the creation of a joint commission which would monitor Russian troop withdrawals from Chechnya and coordinate financial relations with Russia, post-war reconstruction and humanitarian aid.\"The deferral of a decision on Chechnya's future status is only logical because the problem cannot be solved now in the rage of fighting and mutual distrust,\" Konovalov said.But he said the wording of the deal left scope for different interpretations.Russian nationalist groups as well as some moderate politicians have said that any compromise over the region's independence would trigger separatism in other Russian regions.The Russian constitution does not provide any legal mechanism for the secession of any part of the country.Yeltsin, who had given Lebed sweeping powers to restore peace in Chechnya, has stressed that any peace plan should not violate the constitution.A government expert said the deal will be first challenged on September 6, when rebels plan to mark the fifth anniversary of their independence campaign in the regional capital Grozny, from which Russian troops will have by then been withdrawn.\"The deal might survive if both sides agree that there are no winners, as Lebed had announced,\" the expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.\"But, according to our information, they want to turn the occasion into a celebration of what they see as their victory over Moscow,\" he added. \"If that happens, Lebed might find it difficult to justify the deal.\"Experts said that Lebed's authority to strike deals tackling the political status of any Russian territory was far from obvious.Yeltsin has ordered Lebed to restore peace in Chechnya and gave him unspecified sweeping powers to carry out the task. But the two men have not met since Lebed received his orders.\"Lebed acted like a president in signing the deal,\" Konovalov said. \"It is for the president to sign such papers and he cannot hand over his powers to anyone just saying \"act as a substitute president for me today, please'.\"Someone may question the deal later,\" he added.In the meantime, Yeltsin's position was far from obvious.Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday that Yeltsin had backed Lebed's plan. But there was no word from Yeltsin himself, who had been seen in public only once since late June, sparking rumours about his bad health.Yeltsin aides have said the president's health was alright but the 65-year-old president needed a rest after a vigorous re-election campaign and was vacationing at a hunting lodge outside Moscow.Yeltsin's press office could not be reached for comment on the deal between Lebed and Maskhadov.\"On the one hand, there may be something which had prevented Yeltsin from intervening in the Chechnya talks, and the first guess would be his health,\" Konovalov said. \"But there is also a possibility that Yeltsin wants to leave his hands free\".\"If Lebed succeeds, Yeltsin will come out from the shade, and grab the fruits of the victory,\" he added. \"If things go wrong, Yeltsin could put the blame on aides unable to run the country in his absence.\"", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "An uneasy calm has fallen over South African rugby -- off the field at least -- as the game's administrators hope that Black August is behind them.Minister of sport, Steve Tshwete, and Rian Oberholzer, chief executive of the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU), met on Tuesday in an attempt to mend their differences which have seen the sport's image suffer.Tshwete, normally a moderate and conciliatory voice, had said on Saturday that the Springboks had \"taken everyone for a ride\" last year when they projected a spirit of national unity in winning the world cup under the slogan \"one team, one country\".In a statement issued to the press he also said SARFU had failed to deliver on their promises of rugby development.By Tuesday afternoon he had taken it back although SARFU clearly remains on trial. Rugby, he said, was perceived as a white sport but he accepted they were taking steps to change that image.On Saturday coloured flanker Sean Plaatjies will make history when he becomes the first non-white to captain the South African Schools team when they meet Scottish Schools in a curtain-raiser to the second test against the All Blacks in Pretoria.\"South African rugby has nothing to hide,\" SARFU press officer, Alex Broun, told Reuters.\"It has certainly been a difficult month and a number of off-the-field incidents, many of which we have had no control over, have attempted to disrupt the Springbok team.\"The problems started with the selection of 29-year-old hooker Henry Tromp as a replacement for the August 3 test against Australia in Bloemfontein.Tromp is seen as representing the worst of the old South Africa. In 1992 he and his father were convicted of beating 16-year-old Daniel Bongone who later died from internal injuries.Both men were found guilty of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm but outrage at the incident was heightened when Tromp served only nine months in prison while on remand.His selection re-opened old wounds which were exacerbated by the re-appearance of the old flag of the republic, the \"vierkleur\" (four colour) in the Bloemfontein test.Springbok manager Morne du Plessis issued a statement in the name of the team condemning those who carried it.But later the issue snowballed when Pienaar was reported on Afrikaans radio as saying: \"The crowds will be welcome even if they bring the old flag, they may still come and watch.\"The stony silence of SARFU's unpopular president, Dr Louis Luyt, on all the issues fuelled the belief that the game was happy to turn its back on new the South Africa.Team discipline has also troubled the Springboks.Prop Os du Randt was \"severely reprimanded\" for feigning injury in order to be replaced in the Cape Town test on August 10.Winger James Small was not considered for selection for the following test in Durban on August 17 after he was seen in a nightclub at 2:00 a.m. on the eve of the Cape Town match.At a subsequent disciplinary hearing Small admitted being in the club and he has again been overlooked for Saturday's test against the All Blacks in Pretoria.If the Springboks lose that game it will become an All Black August for they will have suffered the fate of becoming the first South African team to lose a home series to New Zealand.And should it happen, SARFU will be under pressure again, but this time to replace Springbok coach Andre Markgraaff for whom it would be a fifth defeat in seven matches this season.", "label": ["GCAT", "GSPO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

However the watchdog urged careful vetting of advertisements using images which could be misconstrued as \"racial metaphors\".The Persil commercial, part of a Unilever campaign to show the cleaning powers of its newly-relaunched washing powder, also featured an ice skater dressed in white speeding away from his black-garbed companions, and a dalmatian dog shaking itself so that all its black spots flew off.Unilever told the ITC it had created visual metaphors to support the soap powder's slogan 'To set clean free'.Research on the likely acceptability of the commercial had included talks with Afro-Caribbean women, the company added.The ad was created for Unilever by J Walter Thompson.Complaints about another recent ad campaign were also based on the issue of race.A poster for Benetton, the Italian retailer known for its controversial ads, showing a black horse mounting a white horse was scrapped last month because poster site owners said it was too shocking.

Forces of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) were leaving.U.N. sources said about 12,000 Iraqi troops were aiding the KDP to capture the PUK stronghold.Residents reported heavy casualties from shelling and said terrified civilians were fleeing.PUK leader Jalal Talabani told Reuters by telephone from Arbil that he had warned Washington three days in advance that the Iraqi forces were prepared to attack Arbil.\"The Americans promised to attack them (the Iraqis). They did not act decisively,\" Talabani said.Talabani said he had not yet given up hope for U.S. intervention, adding a meeting was expected in Washington in several hours' time to review the situation. He did not elaborate.There was no immediate reaction from the United States to Iraq's attack on Arbil which lies about 20 km (12 miles) north of the 36th parallel -- the line that Iraqi forces have been barred by allied forces from crossing since just after the end of the 1991 Gulf War when Iraq tried to seize control of the area.U.S., British and French warplanes are based in southern Turkey under Operation Provide Comfort to protect the zone.KDP leader Massoud Barzani said his faction was being backed by Iraqi heavy armour and artillery, a senior U.N. official in Baghdad said.\"They have confirmed to us that Iraqi troops are taking part in the attack on Arbil...We got the information from KDP leaders in KDP headquarters in Saladdin,\" the official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.The two factions, split along political and tribal lines, have a long history of fighting each other and forging shifting alliances with the main powers in the region -- Iraq and Iran.The Iraqi government in Baghdad said it had decided to \"provide support and military aid\" for the KDP in its fight against the PUK.In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said Iraq's military intervention was in response to a plea from Barzani to President Saddam Hussein to back him militarily against attacks by Iran and Talabani.The KDP has long sought to break the grip of the PUK over Arbil, the seat of a Kurdish government and parliament that was created jointly by the two factions in elections after the 1991 Gulf War after a rebellion against Iraqi rule.The United States twice negotiated a ceasefire between the two rival Kurdish factions this month. But there were repeated violations. The two factions met at the U.S. embassy in London on Friday for talks to consolidate the ceasefire.President Bill Clinton on Friday ordered the U.S. military to prepare for possible deployment in the Gulf and a White House spokesman said Washington was carefully monitoring Iraqi troop activity in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.A U.S. Navy spokesman in Bahrain said American forces, combat vessels and fighter planes patrolling the Gulf could respond to threatening Iraqi troop movements in northern Iraq immediately if called upon,\"We would be able to respond immediately to the threat in northern Iraq.

The share capital of the unit, Hopewell (Thailand) would be raised to US$1 billion, he added.The Thai unit is responsible for the construction of a mass transit system in Bangkok.Hopewell executives were not immediately available for comment.The CREATA listing plan was scrapped beacuse it would be difficult for investors to evaluate project risk if investments in China and Thailand are combined, the Economic Times quoted Hopewell executive director Lawrence Miao as saying.Placement of an individual project would also be easier, he added.  Hopewell had been mulling the spin off of CREATA, which holds the group's transport interests in China and Thailand and has a book value estimated at HK$15 billion, to raise fund for its project developments.Wu said Hopewell (Thailand)'s current share capital is around 12 billion baht and will be increased by a further 13 billion baht by year end, the Sing Tao Daily reported.This was expected to be financed through a private share placement and Hopewell's interest in the Thai rail system would be diluted to around 50 percent, he was quoted as saying.Wu had estimated in late July that Hopewell (Thailand)'s share capital would raise to 20 billion baht from 12 billion.-- HONG KONG NEWSROOM (852) 2843 6369", "label": ["C14", "C171", "C17", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

I wish there were more women (CEOs) who were on the list of Fortune 500 companies,\" Barad, 45, said in an interview.The other female chief executive is Marion Sandler, who heads California thrift Golden West Financial Corp.Barad was named president and chief operating officer of Mattel in 1992. She joined Mattel in 1981 as a product manager and was named marketing director for the Barbie brand in 1982, an appointment that earned her superstar status.When Barad was appointed marketing director for Barbie, the doll's annual sales were only $235 million. Barad refashioned the doll into a versatile career woman, with 100 different versions, which fuelled the toy's popularity. Last year, Barbie's sales hit $1.5 billion.Barad noted that Barbie sales this year remain strong. \"Over-the-counter sales of Barbie are up 22 percent in the U.S. year-over-year,\" she said, noting that total global sales will exceed last year's levels.As CEO, Barad succeeds John Amerman, who will remain chairman. The move had been widely expected as Barad has assumed more responsibility for running the $2.6 billion company.\"Jill Barad has contributed so much to our success during her 15 years with Mattel, and particularly during the four years she has served as my partner in running this company,\" Amerman said in a statement.\"She has proven herself to be an excellent leader, marketer and manager. I have total confidence in Jill and know she will be an outstanding CEO,\" he said.Barad said Mattel was an exception in the toy industry, which like other industries, is still predominantly male-dominated in higher management ranks.\"It's wonderful to be in an an environment in which you can be rewarded, no matter what your gender is,\" she said. \"I wish that for all people.\"Barad's appointment comes as Mattel is shuffling its executive ranks. Earlier this month Mattel named Sony Corp. executive Bruce Stein as president of Mattel Worldwide as part of a realignment of top managers reporting to Barad.Barad said Mattel, despite its failed attempt earlier this year to take over competitor Hasbro Inc., was open to acquisitions.\"If another acquisition came along and made sense and would give us a sustainable core brand ... we'd absolutely go for it,\" she said. Barad would not say if Mattel was in talks with any company.For the 1996 second quarter Mattel reported net income of $66.3 million on revenues of $777.4 million, vs. earnings of $67.5 million on revenues of $763.5 million a year earlier.But Barad said Mattel would meet forecasts for its profits to grow by 15 percent in 1996, and said sales of Disney-related toys this year will top its 1995 total of $450 million.", "label": ["C411", "C41", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "The worldwide hotel alliance between Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels Corp looks like a good deal which should begin to provide substantial benefit from 1998, analysts said on Thursday.Paul Heath of UBS said that the alliance, which will reunite the Hilton brand for the first time since 1964, could add as much as 25 million stg to pre-tax profit in 1998.\"Ladbroke should get quite a big step-up in business across their 160 hotels,\" he said, adding this should outweigh the company's investment in the alliance. \"We are upping our ladbroke numbers (forecasts) as a result of it.\"  UBS are forecasting full-year 1996 pre-tax profit of 175 million stg against 121.3 million in 1995. They expect that to rise to 225 million stg in 1997 and 275 million stg the following year.Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC) owns the Hilton name within the U.S., while Ladbroke has the rights to it everywhere else in the world through its Hilton International (HIC) unit.The two companies have signed an outline agreement to cooperate on sales and marketing, loyalty programmes and hotel development. HHC intends to take a five percent stake in Ladbroke when the deal is finalised.  Ladbroke said it has no immediate plans to take a stake in HHC but said it expected to invest significant sums in hotels and casinos developed by the company in the United States.The agreement provides for a 20 percent profit participation in each other's hotel development in return for a 20 percent contribution to any required capital investment.Fraser Ramzan of Lehman Brothers said it was not clear whether HHC would acquire its stake in Ladbroke by buying existing equity or whether new shares would be issued. \"A possible purchase gives some support to the share price but the fact that there might be more in issue is negative,\" he said.

{"token": "Germany's Bundesbank is highly likely to lower its main money market interest rate this week, finally following through on a promise made in April to cut the rate when conditions allowed, economists said on Tuesday.They said a marked slowdown in the headline growth rate for M3 money supply in July, combined with low inflation and an uneasy economic upturn, meant that the climate was now right for a cut of up to 10-20 basis points in the repo rate.In a Reuter poll of 10 economists, eight believed a small cut in the 3.30 percent rate was on the cards when the central bank council meets on Thursday after a four-week summer break.\"An interest rate cut is appropriate. The M3 figures were in line with expectations and would not block a repo easing,\" said Norbert Braems, senior economist at BZW in Frankfurt.The Bundesbank said today annualised M3 money supply growth dropped to 8.6 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June.Inflation has been running at about 1.5 percent for several months and there is no fear of it gaining pace any time soon.Although July's M3 growth was still above a seven percent target ceiling, analysts said the figure was encouraging as it meant the central bank could reach its goal by the year-end.Signs of a slowdown in M3 were a stated condition for the Bundesbank to lower the repo rate, the rate at which central bank funds are made available to German banks.The rate has been held at 3.30 percent since February, even though the central bank lowered official discount and Lombard rates -- the floor and ceiling for money market rates -- to 2.50 and 4.50 percent respectively in April.Ulrich Beckmann at DB Research responded warmly to the M3 data. \"It was at the lower end of our expectation, which was 8.6 to 9.1 percent,\" he said.\"It is now very clear that we have a very good chance to reach the Bundesbank target zone (of four to seven percent growth for 1996). I think there is a very good chance that we will see a cut in the repo rate,\" he added.Uwe Angenendt, economist at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt, agreed. \"Monetary expansion has slowed considerably. This is a very good sign for the Bundesbank on Thursday. I expect a repo rate cut of 10 to 20 basis points.\"But economists said the final decision could depend on consumer confidence data from the respected Ifo institute, due on Wednesday. Economists expect the business climate index to show at best a small improvement in July.\"M3 will help to argue for cut. But tomorrow's Ifo figures will be more influential as far as a repo cut is concerned,\" said Ros Lifton at Daiwa Europe in London.Analysts expect the index to climb slightly to around 91.0, after hitting a three-month low at 90.4 in June.Although the Bundesbank does not follow an anti-cyclical policy -- lowering rates at any sign of economic weakness -- the current low-inflation environment leaves the Bundesbank fairly free to use its policy to help the economic recovery.It often refers to Ifo data in its reports.\"The Bundesbank will not have any better arguments for easing rates in future than on Thursday,\" said Norbert Meissner at Caisse des Depots et Consignations in Frankfurt.\"The inflationary environment is good and if the Bundesbank wants to help the economy it had better act now.\"But a minority of economists, possibly wary that the central bank appeared four weeks ago to prepare markets for a repo cut, but then failed to deliver the goods, said they had now given up expecting a further easing at all this cycle.Armin Kayser at SBC Warburg said he was also extremely sceptical there would be any economic impact from such a move.\"A cut by a few basis points will not stimulate the economy and it may be that the economy doesn't even need it,\" he said.", "label": ["E121", "E12", "ECAT", "M131", "M13", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

And persons have been detained indefinitely without charge and trial on the orders of the military authorities,\" the Constitutional Rights Project said.Its 55-page report released on Monday in Lagos said that the military government's setting up of tribunals to speed up trials had not worked.\"Our statistics show that the use of tribunals has not improved the delays associated with justice in Nigeria. The Miscellaneous Offences Tribunals set up by the government have a backlog of cases dating to 1991,\" it said.Calling for reform, the CRP said: \"The machinery of administration of justice is not moving justly and efficiently.\"It has brought extensive delays in the prosecution of criminal suspects, and which has resulted in a logjam of cases in courts and confinement of several thousands of people in prison and police custody for long periods without trial.\"The CRP said it wrote the report based on research, on-the-spot visits to the courts, prisons and police stations, and interviews nationwide.The aim was to encourage and advocate reforms in institutions responsible for promotion of human rights and democratic norms in Nigeria, it said.It attributed delays in the prosecution system to: \"inadequate manpower in the prosecution department, insufficient number of courtrooms and lack of investigation tools by the police.\"The human rights group said that military government decrees \"infringe on fundamental human rights, create tribunals which, oust the jurisdiction of courts, negate due processes, preclude judicial appeals...leading to perversion of justice.\"Military-ruled Nigeria has been under fire from the local and international communities for human rights abuses and lack of democracy since the annulment of a presidential election in 1993 meant to have restored democracy.The West African nation was suspended from the Commonwealth, the club of Britain and its former colonies, for the hanging last November of author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists for murder, despite international pleas for clemency.Critics said their trial by a tribunal was flawed. But Nigeria insists the nine were gulity of the murder and the use of the tribunal was meant to treat such a criminal case with dispatch.Among those detained is businessman Moshood Abiola, presumed winner of the annulled poll, for proclaiming himself president in defiance of the military.In April, a United Nations team, which visited the country at the government's invitation, produced a report that called for a reform of draconian laws but backed the three-year transition plan to civilian rule of military ruler General Sani Abacha.A planned visit by Commonwealth ministers to Abuja on August 29-30 to continue discussions on Nigeria's suspension, collapsed because Nigeria set strict terms that the visit \"should not be misconstrued as a Commonwealth fact-finding mission.\"The CRP suggested a review of the \"detention without charge or trial\" concept to eliminate delays in the prosecution system.\"The number of judicial personnel should be increased, the police should be well-funded and given powers to prosecute suspects within a time limit, failing which suspects should be released on bail,\" it said.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

We are having a tough time moving barrels because of the high prices,\" the trader added.  Gas oil prices have been climbing since July 10 when it touched a low of $23.75 a barrel to the current $25.50. Jet fuel prices have been even stronger, climbing from $23.65 on June 27 to current levels of above $28.50.Traders said they were finding it hard to sell jet fuel at 30-40 cents a barrel above Singapore spot quotes, free-on-board basis (fob) and gas oil at 40-50 cents premiums.They said there were \"some length\" in gas oil supplies in Singapore, rather than a full storage situation, while the MidEast market was quite tight. But one trader said he was not surprised if jet fuel stocks here were at \"tank-top.\"  Traders therefore had expected Singapore's weekly middle-distillates stocks to rise. The Trade Development Board announced on Thursday stocks level for the week ended August 21, rose by 335,000 barrels to 7.623 million barrels, the highest since early April.Traders said Singapore refiners were feeling some anxieties as there were excess South Korean cargoes--estimated between seven and 10--while China was not buying large volumes. They said high gas oil prices have spooked away Chinese buyers who continued to hold on to bids of $190 a tonne, cost-and-freight basis, while sellers were seeking around $200.  China was estimated to have bought only 250,000 tonnes of gas oil in August and were not expected to buy more than that for September at current prices. China's purchases have been limited to small lots rather than the normal 25,000-tonne cargoes, traders said.They also said India's purchase of only 255,000 tonnes for September added a bearish undertone for the month.While Indonesia was expected to give some boost, its additional gas oil and jet fuel demand due to the shutdown of two refineries in September and October might not be enough to offset the softer demand from China and India, they said.  Some traders expect Indonesia to buy around 3.0 million barrels of gas oil and over 1.0 million barrels of jet fuel for September.Japan's winter kerosene stockpiling has also not stirred spot market activities and traders said the current high prices might slip in September. South Korean winter jet fuel imports were expected to drop 20 percent from last year as endusers buy more term barrels and as Korean refiners become self-sufficient with the startup of new units.At least two MidEast jet fuel cargoes were also seen heading east in September, adding to regional supplies, traders said.  But traders painted a different picture for the middle-distillate market in October. India was expected to give some boost to gas oil with estimates for its October tender ranging from 500,000-700,000 tonnes to as high as 800,000-1.0 million tonnes.

The rate hikes should help contain inflation, but grocery prices were projected to rise 4.8 percent in 1997, contributing to acceleration in the consumer price index from a 2.8 percent gain in 1995 to a 3.4 percent gain in 1997, the study said.The forecast assumed current economic policies would continue during the next two years.\"If fully implemented, the Dole economic program is expected to raise interest rates, raise inflation and raise the deficit while having only minor effects upon economic growth,\" Ratajczak said. \"Cutting taxes and, therefore, raising government debt before cutting the budget is responsible for this outcome.\"The forecast said continuation of Clinton policies will create more government and slightly less growth but that inflation, interest rates and the deficit will be lower than under the Dole proposals.On average, consumers are not overextended because their net worth has increased nearly 20 percent in the past year. But consumer debt has increased seven percent while income has only grown five percent.\"Therefore, the 60 percent of households that do not have significant direct holdings in financial assets may be overextended,\" Ratajczak said.That will help push 1996 personal bankruptcy filings to one million, though reduced stigma and abuse of the bankrputcy code will also contribute.The report said the economy should continue to expand at moderate rates through 1997. But reduced consumer spending, slowing of capital spending and the topping out of an inventory building that has just started could threaten recession in 1998.\"This is especially true if the Federal Reserve delays too long in restraining industrial inflation and allows price speculation again to influence economic decisions,\" Ratajczak said.The forecast said stock prices would slow their gain in 1997 because of reduced profit growth and interest rate concerns, while recessionary fears will restrain equity values later in 1997.--Jane Sutton, 305-374-5013", "label": ["E11", "E12", "ECAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Algeria's presidency and opposition parties have drawn up an election law to introduce proportional representation instead of the two round majority system that brought Islamists close to power five years ago and violence when when the vote was cancelled.\"Twenty-nine political parties and presidency's reprentatives unanimously agreed on the new text of the election law after nine days of debate,\" an opposition party spokesman involved in preparing the draft said on Saturday.Political parties and government representatives earlier this week also drafted a law that would ban Islamists parties.The two-round majority election system was blamed by anti- Islamists for helping Moslem fundamentalists win local elections in 1990 and a first round of general elections.The cancellation of a general elections in January 1992 started civil strife in which an estimated 50,000 people have been killed.The new proposed draft law was wrapped up on Saturday by the parties and presidency representatives, said the spokesman, speaking by telephone from Algiers.Their committee was one of four working groups set up 10 days ago to hammer out details of a broad consensus over President Liamine Zeroual proposed reforms.Zeroual plans to hold a national conference, likely in mid-September, followed by a referendum to amend the constitution this year and hold general elections in 1997.The new election law will enable an estimated one million Algerian expatriates to vote, officials said.\"The draft law was drawn in order to ban politicians from seeking more than one mandate and widen Algeria's political representation...It also will open the gate for many Algerians to enter politics,\" said one official.The law drawn up on Thursday to tighten rules on political parties' activity and to ban Islamist parties will give current legal parties, including two Islamist groups, one year in which to change their focus or founding principles in order not to run foul of the law.The mainstream radical Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was outlawed in 1992 after violence followed the cancellation of the election in which it had taken a commanding lead. But Algeria still has two legal Islamist parties, Nahda and Hamas.A joint committee on tidying up the consitution also reached agreement on Thursday that Islam is Algeria's state religion.The secular opposition Socialist Forces Front walked out this month from Zeroual's talks, although the former sole ruling party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), took part.The outlawed FIS was excluded.The new draft laws will be submitted to Zeroual before being sent to a government-appointed Transitional National Council to be approved.Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia gave an upbeat assessement of the last details of the dialogue:\"Algeria is about to overcome this stage (of crisis) in harmony and concord through elections in the near future. The positive results coming daily from the multilateral committees confirm this fact,\" Ouyahia, quoted by the official Algerian news agency APS, told economic officials on Saturday.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVOTE"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "North Sea crude oil was stable at low levels on Tuesday as an overhang of early September barrels, especially Statfjord and Gullfaks, weighed on premiums.October Brent was talked about 30 cents above Monday at $20.30-20.35 by 1745 GMT, but wet Brent traded again at 25 cents discount to September paper. This weakness was reinforced by the fate of Tuesday's Brent dates, one of which was in dispute and the other deferred until late September\"All in all it's looking a bit weak.

Option activity on the SFE has been entirely in call options, signalling an anticipation of a rising market, Stevenson said.Call options give the buyer the right to convert the option into a bought futures contract. A A$200.00 call option carries the right to convert to a bought futures contract at A$200.00 a tonne. If the option costs A$10.00, the futures market needs to rise beyond A$210.00 before the option buyer makes money.A put gives the right to turn the option into a sold futures contract at the strike price.  \"Only three weeks ago we did not have a January option on the books. So it's all happened pretty quickly,\" Stevenson said.\"It's the commencement of options trading in wheat in Australia -- there's been interest in those options almost every day,\" he said.At Ords, Lindsay said Australian wheat and canola growers were historically greater users of options than of futures.Options were being quoted at fairly realistic premiums by several different trade bodies, with grantors of the options happy to do them in 500 tonne lots.This was looked on favourably by growers, Lindsay said.  \"People are seeking them (options) all the time,\" he said.Twenty January call options traded on the Sydney Futures Exchange on Wednesday, against three futures trades.The SFE contract size is 50 tonnes of Australian Standard White (ASW) wheat.-- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800", "label": ["M141", "M14", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

World Food Programme (WFP) on Tuesday started sending fuel to other other U.N. agencies to keep them working.\"None of the U.N. agencies have much stock and by the end of the week it will only be WFP and UNHCR (the U.N. refugee agency) who have fuel. My view is we share stocks just to postpone the problem,\" WFP's acting director Benoit Thiry told Reuters.Aid agencies in Burundi usually require about 180,000 litres (40,000 gallons) of fuel per month, but U.N. agencies, by far the largest organisations, have only 25,000 litres, Thiry said.A regional sanctions committee meets on Saturday in Nairobi and agencies are lobbying so more humanitarian supplies are exempted from the embargo.The army on Tuesday accused Hutu rebels of attacking three districts just outside Bujumbura to steal food and cattle.\"We don't know exactly how many people were killed, but it was quite a serious attack and security forces intervened swiftly,\" said army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Longin Minani.Artillery fire was audible in the lakeside capital this weekend from a campaign launched by the military in rural Bujumbura to drive out rebels from hills close to the city.The director of Burundi's electricity supply company said on Tuesday power to the capital should be restored by Wednesday.But the military-appointed government is already rationing petrol and fuel and long lines of vehicles are a common sight.\"They say we have a blockade to return Burundi to democracy, but at least since the coup we have hope,\" said a waiting motorist, reflecting a defiant mood in the largely Tutsi city.", "label": ["E51", "E512", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Excluding the dead, he said 24 people were still unaccounted for.Nearly 200 searchers hampered by thick mud strewn with tree trunks, collapsed houses and other debris, resumed operations on Saturday at the disaster site near Kampar town in the northern state of Perak, police said.At least 30 other houses in the village of some 700 tribespeople were damaged. Rescue efforts have also focused on Kampung Sahom, another village about five km (three miles) downstream, where the wrecked houses were swept.Most of the inhabitants of Pos Dipang are from the Orang Asli Semai tribe, the largest of Malaysia's 18 aborigine groups. An estimated 30,000 Semai dwell in peninsula Malaysia, many in Perak state.Pos Dipang village was a typical aborigine settlement, built in a remote location on a river bank. Located some 4-5 km (2.5-3 miles) from the nearest town, it has no treated water, no phone lines and is accessible by just one road.The original settlers of Malaysia lead relatively primitive lives, clustered in villages or government settlements.

{"token": "Albania's conservative President Sali Berisha on Monday dismissed steps by his Socialist rivals to modernise their party, saying reformers had been hijacked by former communists and secret police agents.Berisha said a key Socialist congress this weekend had shown that the party was riven by faction-fighting and incapable of embracing social democracy.\"The (former communist) Party of Labour with a new name could not be reformed. So-called reform was simply a clan struggle,\" said Berisha, whose Democratic Party won nearly all parliamentary seats in a disputed general election in May.\"In yesterday's congress, reforming elements were replaced by former ministers of (last communist president) Ramiz Alia, collaborators and persecutors of the Sigurimi secret police,\" Berisha added.The Socialists, heirs to the former communist party headed by Stalinist Enver Hoxha that ruled for four decades, on Sunday scrapped Marxist doctrine and officially condemned the Hoxha dictatorship in a ground-breaking weekend congress.More than 600 delegates backed proposals to help stimulate the private sector, support legitimate private business and back private ownership of land in the biggest lurch away from the left since the fall of communism in 1990.Jailed Socialist leader Fatos Nano was re-elected party chief but drew criticism from some delegates for proposing that some ex-communist officials should sit on a new ruling body.Berisha's comments will do little to help produce a climate for more open dialogue and cooperation between Albania's political parties following a bitter general election.Opposition parties boycotted the election half way through the May 26 vote after complaining of voter intimidation and fraud. Foreign observers said the election did not meet international standards.Tension rose further when riot police beat and arrested opposition leaders during a rally two days after the poll.The United States and the European Union, which expressed concern over the conduct of the election, have urged Tirana to hold a fresh general election at the earliest opportunity.Foreign governments have signalled that they will be watching nationwide local elections on October 20 closely to ensure Albania is sticking to its commitment to democracy.The U.S. State Department also called on the ruling Democrats on Friday to give a bigger role to the opposition parties in preparing for the local elections.But the Socialists, who refuse to take up the few seats they won in parliament, have warned Berisha that they will boycott the October vote because they say an electoral commission organising the poll is biased towards the ruling Democrats.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Alexander Lebed, the Kremlin security chief, flew to Chechnya on Friday for new talks with separatist leaders with an outline of a framework document on how to define its future status, Interfax news agency said.Itar-Tass news agency said that before his departure Lebed, whom President Boris Yeltsin has given sweeping but unclear powers to settle the Chechen conflict, had spoken by telephone to the Kremlin chief, who is on holiday outside Moscow.The presidential press service could not confirm that the conversation took place and had no information about the activity of Yeltsin on Friday.Interfax quoted Lebed's press secretary as saying he aimed at reaching \"sweeping agreements\" at the current stage of talks but adding that the rebels might need some time to consider Moscow's proposals.The spokesman gave no details of the draft plan but said it dealt with political aspects of the conflict -- the most sensitive issue in the 20-month-old war in which more than 30,000 people have been killed.Interfax said Lebed's trip would last one day and he would fly first to the capital of the neighbouring region of Dagestan and then move to the separatist region by helicopter.Lebed, 46, broke off talks on a political settlement last weekend with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov, saying he had to return to Moscow to iron out legal questions and cover his back against unnamed opponents within the Russian establishment.Since his return, he has been unable to get a meeting with Yeltsin, who took off on holiday on Monday near Moscow.Kremlin spokesmen say Yeltsin, 65, who asked for written details of Lebed's proposals on Tuesday, is keeping in touch with his envoy without needing to speak to him. They deny rumours that the president is ill but say he needs to rest.Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin held a meeting with Lebed and top officials including the defence, interior and justice ministers and the head of the FSB security service.In an apparent setback, Interfax quoted a spokesman for Chernomyrdin as saying on Thursday: \"Alexander Lebed's plan of action...in Chechnya needs a lot of work.\"Lebed arranged an ambitious ceasefire last week shortly after Yeltsin made him his personal envoy to Chechnya.\"The war has been stopped. Now we have to create the conditions so that it does not resume,\" Lebed said on Thursday.The truce Lebed brokered has held so far, putting an end to a spate of fierce fighting which began on August 6 when rebel fighters seized much of the capital, Grozny.Both sides have pulled forces out of some areas and Russian and rebel fighters are jointly patrolling parts of Grozny.Tass said president of the self-styled Republic of Ichkeria Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev might take part in Friday's talks.Interfax said Yandarbiyev had on Thursday met Tim Guldimann, the Swiss diplomat who heads the Chechnya mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Few details of Lebed's proposed settlement have emerged. It must find a compromise between the referendum the separatists want, which they think would back outright secession, and Moscow's refusal to countenance full independence.Both sides indicate they might agree on a vote in some years' time, once the North Caucasus has recovered from the war.", "label": ["GCAT", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Many people recall Soviet times when they inevitably lost from currency measures.He was also sceptical whether people would abide by the government's planned month-long price freeze on goods and services after the hryvna's introduction, meant to limit the inevitable confusion.One woman said prices for butter and vodka rose immediately after the hryvna announcement and many stores, nervous about the change, put more expensive items like appliances away to sell after the new currency becomes effective.\"(President Leonid) Kuchma can't regulate this.

Bardhan, head of a six-doctor panel attending her, told Reuters.An official at the hospital had earlier told Reuters after the initial signs of deterioration that \"we are now worried\".Mother Teresa's heart, which has a pacemaker, had weakened on Friday when doctors administered medicine for a recurrence of malaria, which she first contracted in 1993.She remained conscious throughout Friday but was unable to speak. \"She mumbled something when the Bishop of Calcutta came to visit her,\" a nurse said, adding that she also recognised West Bengal's Marxist chief minister, Jyoti Basu, when he came to visit her in the afternoon.Mother Teresa, known as a living saint for her work for the destitute and poor, was admitted to Woodlands on Tuesday with a temperature of 103 Fahrendheit (39.4 Celcius) and severe vomiting. She developed heart problems on Wednesday, but had responded to treatment and was in stable condition until Friday morning.

Very good meetings,\" Gold told reporters after his talks with el-Baz.\"I think we are deepening the understanding between the different countries in the Middle East,\" he said.The secretive talks, expected to cover doubts cast over the Cairo conference by uncertainties in the peace process, took place at Paris' central Bristol Hotel, the venue for previous discreet Arab-Israeli meetings.Ross was later due to meet French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette \"to discuss some concerns about the peace process\", a ministry spokesman said.Ross already met a senior French foreign ministry official on Monday to tighten coordination between the two countries in Middle East diplomacy.In an apparent confusion, the U.S. embassy had said on Monday Ross, Gold and el-Baz had already met, but the Israeli and Egyptian embassies said the talks began on Tuesday.\"We were told that it had happened. We don't know,\" a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy said.Officials of all three embassies said the talks were being arranged directly by their capitals, effectively bypassing the missions. The U.S. spokeswoman said Ross was not in touch with the embassy.The talks were expected to focus on the Middle East economic conference planned in Cairo in November which has been called into question by frictions between Israel and Arab neighbours since the election of Netanyahu.President Mubarak showed signs of reluctance about the conference last week, saying many Middle East states would not attend unless Israel ensured the peace process moved forward.Netanyahu, apparently shaken by Mubarak's suggestion that he might cancel the summit, later phoned the Egyptian president to tell him that talks with the Palestine Liberation Organisation would resume soon.Netanyahu, elected in May, is opposed to exchanging occupied Arab land for peace, the bedrock of the peace policy of the Labour government he replaced.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDIP"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The following are comments from economists and traders on the decision of the Bundesbank to cut the main securities repurchase rate, or repo, to 3.00 percent from the 3.30 percent level seen since February.A Reuter survey showed seven of 10 economists polled believed the Ifo institute business climate index, which on Wednesday jumped to an eight-month high of 94.1 in July, had decreased the chance of a repo rate cut at the meeting.A poll of the economists before the Ifo data showed 8 of 10 economists expected a rate cut of five to 20 basis points.  Uwe Angenendt, BHF Bank, Frankfurt:\"We had not expected such a large step. The Bundesbank appears to have made this decision a while ago and it was down to the timing. It now looks as though M3 money supply will go back into the four to seven percent target growth corridor. This is positive news for the dollar. I see a strengthening of the dollar against the mark on this news.\"It is difficult to say whether this will be the end of rate cuts in this cycle. We see a strengthening of the economy, and against that background it could be an end to this cycle. But we have to wait for more data.\"  Stefan Schneider, Senior Economist, Paribas Capital Markets, Frankfurt:\"After yesterday's strong improvement in the July Ifo index, the consensus switched in favour of no change. It was quite a big surprise. I believe more and more signs of the German economy recovering has limited the scope of the Bundesbank to keep the interest rate fantasy alive.\"I interpret this cut as the final move in interest rates for this cycle.Patrick Mange, Deutsche Bank France, Paris:\"After this cut, there could be other key rate cuts but it will depend on the economic pace. We do not expect as strong an economy in the second half. We will probably make at least another move on the repo rate.\"The discount rate is more difficult to say. We can expect the repo rate to go back to a level of about 2.75 percent. But after that level a cut would be needed in the discount rate.\"Michael Hochguertel, Head of Money Market, BHF Bank, Frankfurt:\"I must say that I am a little surprised by the move. I expected a maxmium cut of 10 basis points. I was under the influence of that Ifo report. I am a bit confused by this 30 basis point cut. I would also say that a further cut at the moment is not on the cards.It obviously means that M3 is going in the right direction. It is also reflecting that inflation is not a problem and the economy is not as strong as we think it is. It is reflecting concerns about unemployment and the current economic prospects.\"--Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525", "label": ["E12", "ECAT", "M131", "M13", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Gen. Clifton Poole, acting president of the college, told reporters. The Citadel dropped its 153-year-old all-male policy this summer after the U.S. Supreme Court said a similar rule at Virginia Military Institution, the nation's only other state-funded all-male school, was unconstitutional.Last year, one woman, Shannon Faulkner, was admitted to The Citadel under a federal court order but dropped out after a week, citing stress and isolation. The four women and 581 men in The Citadel's first truly coeducational class started the day at 5:20 a.m. on Monday with reveille.\"In the past we were single gender. I wish we were still single gender, but the law of the land is we cannot continue this path,\" Poole said. \"What we're focusing on now is trying to focus our energy on making the new role successful.\"By noon the new cadets had been addressed by the commandant and regimental commander and visited the cadet store, tailor shop and barber shop.The women -- Petra Lovetinska, Nancy Mace, Jeanie Mentavlos and Kim Messer -- did not get the traditional cut given to knobs -- the new students so dubbed because of their shaved heads, nor was it a standard military cut. Instead, they got a haircut similar to a man's crew cut.\"The basic standards of the hair cut is off the face, off the shoulders, off the collar,\" Poole said.The Citadel went through a \"painstaking\" procedure to assure that the female cadets receive female haircuts, designed with the assistance of a local hair salon, said Col. Joseph Trez, commandant of cadets.The media were prohibited from interviewing new cadets but some upperclassmen said they were surprised at how short the women had to cut their hair.", "label": ["GCAT", "GDEF"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

We've had it out there for weeks and weeks and weeks,\" Dole said.Dole said former first lady Nancy Reagan was laughed at with her \"just say no\" anti-drug message. \"But it worked,\" Dole said.Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Dole's running mate, Jack Kemp, campaigned aggressively for the black vote in an area that was the flashpoint of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.Kemp told a crowd of about 300 African Americans in south central Los Angeles, \"Keep your eyes open, keep your ears open, keep your heart open. I want to tell you with all my heart that we want to win your vote.\"In Dole's address to a group that was largely white, the presidential nominee likened the stream of illegal drugs into the United States to missiles aimed at American children and promised to appoint federal judges who would be tough on illegal drug use.\"They're aiming millions and millions of missiles right at these young people, whether it's a needle, whether it's a cigarette, whatever the delivery system is -- it's poison and it's got to stop in America.\" he said.Dole said 70 percent of the cocaine that entered the United States and 40 percent of the marijuana came from Mexico. \"We've got an international problem and I'm prepared to use our military might. We want to stop drugs at the border,\" he said.Dole's remarks prompted questions about whether he was seeking a ban on cigarettes. \"I didn't say anything about cigarettes. I was talking about drugs. I said you shouldn't smoke either. That's all I said,\" he replied as he was shaking hands with well-wishers.When asked specifically if he was suggesting a ban on cigarettes, Dole replied: \"Oh no. Come on, you know better than that.\" Dole campaign aides said the candidate was telling young people not to smoke.Dole also said he opposed California Proposition 215 which, if approved by voters, would allow the cultivation of marijuana plants for medicinal uses. Dole said the initiative would allow marijuana to be used for anything from a headache to an ingrown toenail.In an effort to paint the drug issue in non-political terms, Dole said three times during his 20-minute address that illegal drug use was neither a Democratic nor a Republican issue but one that involves all people.The anti-drug message is a theme Dole feels has strong voter appeal. On Sunday near Chicago he accused President Bill Clinton of \"raising the white flag\" in the war on drugs.A recent survey showed that illegal drug use among 12-17 year-olds had doubled in the past four years.Dole was flanked by several California Republican politicians including Gov. Pete Wilson, who said local and state governments cannot fight illegal drugs alone.\"We need all the help we can get. We need to get the kind of help we used to get when Ronald Reagan and George Bush were in the White House,\" Wilson said.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "India's Asian neighbours criticised New Delhi's decision to block a global treaty banning nuclear tests and called its stance unrealistic.\"It is highly regrettable that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was not adopted at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva because of opposition from some countries, including India,\" Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said.On Tuesday India, which led opposition to the treaty, prevented the adoption of the pact at the disarmament negotiations and pledged to try to block it being forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly.New Delhi said it had two main objections to the treaty.It said the pact would allow the five declared nuclear powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- to retain their nuclear arsenals while the nuclear \"have-nots\" would be barred from obtaining the weapons.India also opposed a provision that would require New Delhi, along with the five declared powers and the two other \"threshold\" states, Israel and Pakistan, to sign the agreement before it could become international law.But U.S. disarmament negotiator Stephen Ledogar said India was shielding its real motive.\"The real reason is that the current government in New Delhi wants to maintain the Indian nuclear weapon option,\" Ledogar said in Geneva on Tuesday.India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb. However, the government's longstanding strategic doctrine has been to retain the option to equip itself with nuclear weapons if threatened.New Zealand said India's professed goal of forcing the nuclear powers to commit to a disarmament timetable was unrealistic. Most countries believe the Geneva talks were never meant to be sweeping negotiations but rather a stepping stone towards eventual disarmament.\"We certainly want to see progress to the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons,\" a New Zealand foreign ministry official said in Wellington.\"So we share the same goal, but to seek in this treaty, which is about banning tests, a commitment to a timetable to achieve everything else, is unrealistic.\"The New Zealand official said India's stand-alone stance threatened to scuttle 2-1/2 years of negotiations. \"By trying to get everything at once, you put at risk what has been achieved, the progress that's been made,\" he said.New Zealand said it was working with other countries to try to forward the treaty to the U.N. General Assembly where it could be approved by a majority. At the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, agreement requires a consensus.\"The point has been reached where negotiations won't achieve anything more in Geneva,\" the New Zealand official said.Indonesia joined in the generally muted criticism of India, saying it regretted New Delhi's stance.\"We regret it because Indonesia is already in line with the concept of nuclear neutrality in this (Asia) region.

All the roads to Pahalgam are flooded.

Lindblad did not have an exact measurement of the nerve gas leak, but said it was only trace amounts -- small enough for a worker to be safe in the area without a mask.\"You're talking about molecules,\" he said.The leak occurred during the process of draining the agent from the rockets and cutting them up for incineration.\"Anytime you cut a rocket, you're going to have a little bit of vapor come out,\" Lindblad said, adding that Army planners had anticipated such a leak would occur during the three- to four-month testing period.He said the Army experienced similar problems at its pilot incinerator on Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean and consequently installed the detection filters at Tooele.Lawyers for environmentalists who unsuccessfully opposed the Tooele incinerator in federal court had argued the Army's plans did not sufficiently correct the problems at Johnston Atoll.The Army and its subcontractor, E.G.& G. Inc.'s (EGG.N) E.G.&G. Defense Materials Inc., began trial burns of nerve gas-filled M-55 rockets on Thursday and had incinerated 205 rockets before Saturday's shutdown.About 44 percent of the nation's chemical weapons stockpile is housed at Tooele.

{"token": "Orders for costly manufactured goods staged a broad-based surge in July, the Commerce Department reported on Friday, surprising financial markets and raising questions as to whether the economy is indeed slowing, as analysts had thought.Orders for costly durable goods, ranging from communications equipment to computers, climbed 1.6 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $172.7 billion after a revised 0.2 percent fall in June and a robust 4.2 percent May increase.Analysts said manufacturing industries were headed into the second half of the year on a much stronger note than anticipated, freed of bulging inventories by brisk demand.\"The manufacturing sector had a rough patch but it now seems to be over,\" said Pierre Ellis, an economist with Lehman Brothers in New York. \"Demand clearly is there and what is striking is the breadth of the increase in it.\"Every category of durable good except transportation equipment reflected stronger orders in July. Weakness in demand for ships and for military tanks left overall transportation orders flat, but new cars and parts orders increased from June.Not only were total July orders up, but shipments of finished products gained solidly and order backlogs fattened for the 10th month out of the past 11, primarily because of more orders for new commercial aircraft and parts.The durables report renewed inflation worries and sent bond prices sharply lower.The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell 1-1/4 points, sending its yield climbing to 6.94 percent from 6.83 percent late Thursday. The decline in the bond market put stocks under pressure, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.73 points to 5,722.74.\"This number fits into the story of the economy retaining momentum in the summer,\" said economist Russell Sheldon of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.It was widely thought that the Federal Reserve decided this week to keep interest rates unchanged because of signs the economy was losing steam in the second half of the year so that inflation pressures were abating on their own.Lehman Brothers' Ellis said Fed policymakers, like private economists, may be uncertain what represents \"too strong\" growth that would risk fuelling inflation.He said it also was unclear whether manufacturing was simply regaining its trend of expansion or whether demand was heating up to a degree that threatens to outstrip supply and send prices spiraling upward.Durable goods are products like cars and home appliances that are intended to last at least three years. Rising orders and shipments are an indicator of the health of the manufacturing sector, which generates many of the better-paying jobs that keep incomes rising.The national economy grew at a sharp 4.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, exceptionally strong in the sixth year of expansion from the 1990-91 recession.However, Ellis said the Lehman Brother Global Economics model still showed the pace of growth easing down to 2.5 percent in the third quarter and to 2.5 percent to 3 percent in the final quarter.Previously, the Commerce Department said durable goods orders had fallen 0.6 percent in June. But it revised that to show only a 0.2 percent decline.The sole weakness in the July report was for transportation equipment, with orders flat after a 1.2 percent drop in June. Excluding transportation, durables orders rose 2.1 percent after a 0.2 percent rise in June and a 1.1 percent rise in May.Orders for electronic and electrical equipment jumped 4.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted $28.1 billion in July after a 3.9 percent gain in June. The department said there were widespread increases in this category, led by communcications equipment.Orders for industrial machinery, which includes computers, rose 2.1 percent in July to $32.3 billion following a 0.2 percent increase in June.Orders for non-defence capital goods, used as an indicator of business investment in new production equipment, climbed a brisk 7.2 percent to $46 billion after a 4.6 percent fall in June.Shipments of durable goods, an indication of current demand, climbed 0.7 percent to $168 billion after dropping 0.4 percent in June.Unfilled orders were up strongly, by 1 percent, to $480 billion in July after a 0.7 percent gain in June.

{"token": "Japan, once a laggard in satellite launching, has shot into the front ranks of space with its H2 rocket's latest success challenging Chinese and European dominance in the field.The H2's success last Saturday in lifting two satellites into orbit, followed three days later by a Chinese rocket's failure in a similar mission, leaves Japan poised to land a billion dollar contract from Hughes Electronics Corp to launch a dozen satellites.Two months ago, the European Space Agency's (ESA) Ariane 5 rocket blew up on its maiden flight, effectively ruling it out as a contender for the Hughes contract.Rocket System Corp, a consortium of 74 Japanese high-tech firms, announced last month it had reached a \"basic agreement\" with Hughes to launch the 12 satellites using an advanced model of the H2 rocket.And after Saturday's success, Japanese officials are now confident the \"basic agreement\" is about to become reality.\"We will announce details of the deal with Hughes once the main contract has been signed, probably in a month or so,\" a spokesman for Rocket System told Reuters on Wednesday.Japanese media said the Hughes deal, at about 8.5 billion yen ($78.7 million) per launch, would firmly place Japan in the global satellite launching business, until now dominated by Europe's Ariane rockets and China's Long March rockets.If the contract is signed, Japan could be launching the first of Hughes' satellites in 2001.Hughes is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors Inc and Rocket System is led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd and Nissan Motor Co.Last Saturday, the indigenously developed H2 rocket lifted two satellites into orbit, with one at 3.6 tonnes, the largest satellite released into orbit by Japan.It was the fourth successful H2 lift-off -- there has not been a failure since the first launch in 1994 - and the first billed as a \"commercial\" and not experimental launch.Japan's government-funded National Space Development Agency (NASDA) owns the rocket but Rocket System Corp is in charge of selling the rocket to commercial clients.The Advanced Earth Observation Satellite (ADEOS) successfully placed in orbit on Saturday is for use by environmental scientists in the United States, Europe and Japan.For NASDA and Rocket System, the four H2 successes neatly pointed up their rocket's reliability against recent failures by the Chinese and European launchers.The European Space Agency (ESA) suffered a major setback last June when its latest model, the Ariane 5, blew up less than one minute after lift-off on its maiden flight.The ESA admitted that the explosion was caused by faulty software and inadequate simulation experiments.One month later, in a sign of how the satellite launching world has changed, the ESA asked Japan's NASDA to launch an experimental communications satellite for it using the first advanced model of the H2, called the H2A.The ESA's Artemis satellite will be launched in 2000 free of cost, although NASDA would be given rights to 200 hours worth of experimental communications using the Artemis.\"The failure of Ariane-5 and the Artemis plea to Japan were not directly linked,\" said Akira Kubozono, a former top NASDA official.\"It's just that the H2 rocket came as a heaven-sent gift for the ESA's satellite division looking for a free lift-off,\" he said.In China's case, there have been two failed launches by its Long March-3 rockets this year, one in February which killed six people on the ground and another one just on Tuesday when it failed to place a domestic communications satellite into orbit.Japan's H2 rocket was once the butt of jokes for its hugely expensive launch costs. At 18.5 billion yen ($171 million), it was double the bill for a U.S. or European launcher and more than four times that of China's.Rocket System hopes to halve the H2 costs mainly by buying foreign parts, mass-producing components, doing away with expensive weldings and improving engine performance.

Russian military sources said the same.Apart from the withdrawal from Grozny, held by the rebels since August 6, the deal provided for an exchange of prisoners and the start of Russian troops' withdrawal from southern Chechnya, where rebel positions are especially strong.The rebel field commander for the southern district of Shatoi told Reuters correspondent Dmitry Kuznets that the local Russian commander had received a pullout order from headquarters and that his regiment would withdraw before next Thursday.The rebel and Russian commanders said later that the first troops would set off from the region on Saturday.Interfax news agency said that before Monday troops would leave other southern districts of Vedeno and Nozhai-Yurt.Army and rebel officials said preparations were under way to form joint monitoring units with the guerrilla forces in Grozny to police the city and separate the warring sides.But the joint patrolling has been met cautiously by many on both sides who have had each other in their gunsights for the past two weeks during the worst fighting in more than a year.\"We have to try it, but I doubt if this is possible with the separatists,\" woman soldier Svetlana Goncharova, 35, said.A rebel fighter Said-Magomed Beldurov, 39, said such patrols could be only a temperary measure.\"We will never agree to permanent joint administration,\" he said. \"This is our city\".Lebed, whom Yeltsin gave sweeping powers to end the 20-month Chechnya war which had killed tens of thousands people, did not hear a word of praise or criticism for the deal from his Kremlin chief on Friday.Itar-Tass news agency said Yeltsin was waiting for a written report on Lebed's latest trip to Chechnya and would not meet him until early next week when the ex-paratroop general is due back from his next trip.Lebed has said that he would return to Chechnya at the weekend to sign a \"political document\" which would define relations between Moscow and Chechnya.Yeltsin has said he wants peace but he rejects rebel demands for full independence. Political analysts doubt whether, after the humiliation of the army in this month's fighting, he will be willing to lose more face by making new concessions.Lebed, however, has said in the past he has no objection to Chechen secession if the region's one million people want it.Lebed, speaking earlier to Russian news agencies, said he would use his powers to sack senior officials if they opposed his plan. \"I'm in command here. I have legitimate authority to fulfil the duties I have been charged with,\" he said.But Yeltsin's backing is crucial for the ex-paratroop general, a novice in the intrigue-filled Kremlin corridors, who has admitted he expects strong resistance to the deal which some forces in Moscow might consider a national humiliation.", "label": ["GCAT", "GPOL", "GVIO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Salomon also cut its earnings estimates on independents across the board, citing seasonal pressure on margins as refiners trim gasoline production and complete autumn maintenance turnarounds to step up heating oil output.\"That's all seasonal,\" said Salomon analyst Neil Quach, adding that relatively low heating oil inventories could in bolster prices and margins in the coming months.U.S. refiners last week stepped up distillate production to bolster heating oil inventories ahead of the winter heating season, adding a net 1.8 million barrels to the nation's heating oil inventories.Distillate inventories on hand at the nation's refineries remained 18.5 million barrels below the same week last year, a shortfall that has prompted technical buying on the futures market and could drive prices higher with the onset of winter.Forecasts on West Texas Intermediate have been raised to an average $19 a barrel range this year and $18 a barrel range for 1997, well above projections at the start of the year.Sun was down 1/4 at 24-1/8, Texaco was up 3/8 at 89-7/8, British Petroleum was off 1-1/8 at 117-7/8 and Tosco was up 1/8 at 48-1/4 on New York Stock Exchange early afternoon trading on Tuesday.-- James Pierpoint, Houston Bureau, (713) 210-8508", "label": ["C15", "C152", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

It was unclear how long the talks would continue.The dispute, which has spurred anti-EU sentiment in Germany, erupted last month when premier Kurt Biedenkopf of the eastern German state of Saxony overrode Commission objections to the size of an aid package for VW and paid out extra funds.Biedenkopf, a Christian Democrat (CDU) ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, warned that the state stood to lose thousands of jobs in the towns of Mosel and Chemnitz if it did not pay.VW had suspended plans to develop plants in the two towns after the European Union executive in June rejected 241 million ($161.7 million) of the total promised aid package of some 780 million marks.Van Miert reacted furiously to Saxony's defiant move, saying the decision to pay 91 million marks in unauthorised support to VW could touch off an EU \"subsidy war\" if left unchallenged.He threatened in a recent German magazine interview that Brussels could raise the stakes by blocking other aid to Europe's largest carmaker or excluding it from public tenders.Bonn has said it accepts Saxony's arguments that the payouts are justified but that it believes the state went too far by defying the order from Brussels.According to Brussels, Saxony paid out 142 million marks to VW after the Commission's June decision. Of this amount, it says 91 million was unauthorised.In total, Volkswagen has received at least 522 million marks from Saxony, which struggles with a jobless rate of more than 15 percent despite rapid economic growth.($=1.4905 marks)", "label": ["C17", "CCAT", "E51", "ECAT", "G15", "G157", "GCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "A Michigan lawmaker is drafting a bill that would require the Detroit Lions football team to repay a $13.9 million state subsidy given to the Pontiac Silverdome.State Rep. Deborah Whyman, R-Canton, said Wednesday the bill should be introduced as soon as next week. The bill was sparked by last week's announcement that the Lions plan to leave the Silverdome for a new, partially taxpayer-subsidized domed stadium in downtown Detroit.Whyman said her bill was aimed at stopping \"nomad sports teams\" from shopping around for a better stadium deal. The $50 million Silverdome was financed with proceeds from Pontiac stadium authority bonds and a 19-year state subsidy totally $13.9 million. About $23 million of the Silverdome's bonds are outstanding, with $13.5 million maturing in 2004 and the remainder maturing in 2006, according to Pontiac officials.\"Now the Lions are seeking to take advantage of another community by asking taxpayers to subsidize another stadium,\" Whyman said.The Wayne County Board voted last week to place a 1 percent lodging tax and 2 percent rental car tax on the Nov. 5 ballot. Revenues from the taxes would be used to back $80 million of bonds for the football stadium.The rest of the cost of the $225 million facility would be paid for with bond proceeds and other funds from the city of Detroit, contributions from the Lions and from the corporate community, as well as other sources.In a statement, the Lion's pointed out that the Silverdome has been used for other events besides football and that the state's subsidy, which ended in 1992, went directly to the city of Pontiac and not to the team.News of Whyman's bill followed action by another Michigan lawmaker who requested a review by the Michigan Attorney General of the legality and constitutionality of the use of certain public funds for the stadium project.--Karen Pierog, 312-408-8647", "label": ["C13", "C17", "C24", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Huntsman Corp. is not interested in pursuing further negotiations nor in commencing an unsolicited tender offer at this time. It is simply not worth the aggravation,\" said Jon Huntsman, chief executive officer and chairman of the family-owned company based in Salt Lake City.Huntsman said the decision came after Rexene financial adviser Schroder-Wertheim indicated the Rexene board would reject bids substantially above its $15 per share offer.Huntsman's first bid of $14 per share was rejected by Rexene on July 22. It then sweetened the offer to $15 per share on Aug. 1, but Rexene rejected that bid as well.The unsolicited bid also included the assumption of $175 million of debt.Rexene's stock, which had risen sharply from about $9 per share after Huntsman first launched its bid, tumbled $2 to $10.50 in after-hours trading on news Huntsman was dropping the offer. Huntsman made its announcement after the market closed.Rexene said it would pursue its own expansion plans.\"Rexene feels it has significant improvement and expansion programmes underway that will enhance stockholder value,\" said Rexene Chairman Andrew Smith. \"We will now go forward with our business plan.\"Huntsman blasted Rexene's rejection of its offer and warned that the cyclical chemical industry is already seeing a decline in margins and prices. In spurning the offer, Rexene said shareholder value would be boosted by its strategic investment plan, which includes additional capacity and the expansion of product offerings.\"In my opinion, Rexene's shareholders won't see our offering in the value of Rexene stock for years to come. The shareholders should be very disappointed,\" Huntsman said.The move marks the second time in recent months that Huntsman, long known for successful acquisitions, failed to win a target company.Huntsman launched a bid for Sterling Chemicals Inc. in April, but the effort failed when the target instead opted for a management and investor buyout.In 1994, Huntsman doubled its size when it acquired Texaco Inc.'s chemical business for $850 million.", "label": ["C181", "C18", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "The French government, facing labour unrest at home and investor worries abroad, pledged on Thursday to combat gloom and push through its economic reforms.Conservative Prime Minister Alain Juppe, standing firm despite attacks on his economic policies, reaffirmed France's commitment to join a single European currency. France will \"meet the deadline for economic and monetary union within the criteria and the timetable,\" he told a meeting of French ambassadors.The franc and French stock and bond markets have been hit recently by renewed fears of serious labour unrest and doubts over France's ability to meet the Maastricht treaty targets for European Economic and Monetary Union.The franc was trading at 3.4267 per mark on Thursday afternoon, back at levels seen before interest rate cuts last week temporarily lifted the currency from its lows of mid-August.Juppe also defended France's battle to squeeze inflation out of the economy and expressed surprise at criticism of that policy.\"We have in the past few years eradicated inflation,\" he said.\"I couldn't have been more stunned to see that in the end, some are sorry,\" he added. \"As though all over the world people are not trying to eradicate inflation because less inflation means more purchasing power and more justice,\" he said in a speech to French ambassadors at the foreign ministry.Juppe was responding to the latest attack on his economic policies, which came from inside his governing majority.Former finance minister Alain Madelin, in an article in daily Le Monde, said France was in a period of falling prices and that government policies would aggravate the deflation problem, leading to social disorder and political instability.Madelin, a fervent supporter of free-market economics, was sacked last August after a clash with Juppe over the speed of economic reform.The government shows no signs of softening its resolve to enact planned reforms to the country's generous welfare system and cut France's public deficit to three percent of gross domestic product, as required by Maastricht.\"I am not a fan of consensus at any price,\" Labour and Social Affairs Minister Jacques Barrot said, defending the government's plans.\"It's not now that France is making choices for the future that we should give in to discouragement, doubt, and, for some, a protest that can only be sterile,\" he added in an interview to be published Saturday in weekly magazine Valeurs Actuel.The ministers' comments came on the heels of a similar call on Wednesday by President Jacques Chirac.\"Now that the bulk of our programme is under way, we must display a willful optimism which leads to dynamism and a winning spirit,\" said Chirac, back from a Riviera holiday and attending his first cabinet meeting after the summer holidays.While most analysts said they do not think this year's social unrest will be as sharp as last year's, unions have warned that government plans for deficit reduction could prompt a repeat of last autumn, when unions virtually crippled France with a 24-day strike over efforts to cut social benefits.Record unemployment, planned public spending cuts and layoffs have infuriated unions, and public anger also has been swelling over the government's handling of African immigrants evicted from a church in Paris after a two-month occupation. They were hoping to renew or gain residence rights in France.Marc Blondel, leader of the non-partisan Force Ouvriere union which was at the heart of last year's strike, has said \"all the ingredients are there for it to explode\".", "label": ["E11", "E12", "E41", "ECAT", "G15", "G154", "GCAT", "GJOB"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

But it added that its insurance business would post a further increase in profits.The company said it wanted to expand its businesses worldwide through both acquisition and organic growth, particularly in the life insurance and investment sectors.\"We do have an external growth strategy and we want to build another strong base in Europe; we want to expand in the U.S. and in the longer term we would like to build a position in Asia as well,\" director Saskia van Opijnen said.Fortis said it expected net profit for the whole of 1996 to rise at least 10 percent while the two parent companies expect full-year earnings per share to rise at least seven percent.", "label": ["C151", "C15", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "Berlin, long mired in its tortured history, is drawing crowds to watch it emerge as a 21st century capital and a peephole into Europe's urban future.Consecutive feats of engineering and nascent architectural wonders have breathed new life into an anaemic tourism industry that slumped when the euphoria over the collapse of the Berlin Wall subsided.Often called Europe's biggest construction site, Berlin is simultaneously preparing for the end of the century arrival of the government from Bonn, filling the gaps created by the Wall and restoring structures left to rot under communism.The latest in the \"what'll they do next?\" series of projects is the temporary shifting of the city's Spree River 70 metres (230 feet) northward to make room to lay a 100 metre-wide (328 cluster of rail, subway and auto tunnels.Nudged with 1,500 tons of stone and 1,000 square metres (10,760 square feet) of sandbags, the central waterway has been shifted to its temporary bed until 1998. Packed tour ships and cargo vessels are already cruising the relocated bend.The tunnel will run below the city's giant Tiergarten park, linking the goverment quarter with the main rail station while reunifying the eastern and western sections of the park split by a service road laid after the infamous Wall was built.As a city long dwarfed by the glamour and popularity of its European cousins, Berlin has spent the 1990s cultivating the hope of once again being accepted as a world capital.The scope of the scheme has created enough traffic nightmares, political mudslinging and just plain mud to aggravate the already typically edgy Berliner.But a private group of investors called Partners for Berlin has brightened the mood in the cash-strapped city with a wildly successful plan to attract visitors to their works-in-progress.Guided tours of the building sites, street parties and elaborate art projects amid the scaffolding and cement trucks have drawn visitors from across Europe.Potsdamer Platz, the largest construction site, is illuminated by night this month under Berlin artist Gerhard Merz's electric light sculpture, strung across 11 building cranes.A guarded optimism clings to each project as Berliners discuss each Baustelle (construction site) as if it were a chance to cast off the city's grim past and start anew.\"People are eager to know how the city is changing, to inform themselves as the city unfolds around them,\" said Baerbel Petersen of Partners for Berlin. \"This is something Berliners take very, very personally.\"Schaustelle (Show Site) Berlin tours meet at the Info Box, a red, three-storey steel pod on stilts where Sony, Daimler Benz and other industrial giants have rolled out their plans for the city with balsa wood models and interactive computer screens.The two-month event has drawn an estimated 300,000 visitors this summer, all without a single mark from public coffers.Aside from the impressive Spree move, engineers this year plucked an elegant turn-of-the-century ballroom from its foundations, lowered it onto rails and deposited it on its future site at Sony's European headquarters, now being built.To meet the environmentalist goal of an 80-to-20-percent ratio between public and private transport, several new rail and subway lines are in the works, including a new central station which will serve 110,000 travellers a day.Nearby, British architect Sir Norman Foster is re-fashioning the future seat of parliament, the imposing Reichstag, as an open chamber of light under a glass dome with a preserved Italian Renaissance facade.The site of Checkpoint Charlie, the tightly-guarded Berlin border crossing for citizens of the Allied countries during the Cold War, is transforming into the American Business Center cluster of office buildings and retail spaces.Even the shames of the earlier Berlin landscape, including the Wall itself, are on drafting tables as politicians and a rapt public debate how to preserve the memory of the past on the city's streets while still allowing municipal rebirth.\"In a city where so much is being newly built in one shot, people fear losing their city,\" Barbara Jakubeit, Berlin's new director of construction, told the daily Tagespiegel. \"There is a call to keep elements of the city's past.\"Of course, this is not the first generation with visions of Berlin as a European beacon. The spectre of Hitler and Bismarck loom large as the city faces the millennium.But while Hitler and his architect Albert Speer dreamt of a stratospheric scale for the buildings of Germania, Berlin's newest constructions remain generally modest and in human proportion. Few structures are larger than four storeys high.The budding centre of high style in east Berlin, Friedrichstrasse, is a narrow shopping avenue beneath gleaming glass and steel department stores, in sharp contrast with the city's many broad boulevards custom-made for military parades.Each new building and every restored edifice seems to represent a healing of the post-war divisions and a new opportunity to define the future of the once-cleaved city as the seat of German government and of European economic power.\"I always had a problem with Bonn as the capital,\" said Berlin architect Olaf Kunkat. \"It always represented our post-war situation. We weren't allowed to grow or expand.\"Now we are old enough and strong enough to recreate this city as a world democratic capital and to show the world that we can control ourselves. Part of that is the opportunity to be the future of architecture, the absolute state of the art.\"", "label": ["C24", "CCAT", "E511", "E51", "ECAT", "GCAT", "GTOUR"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

{"token": "European rate futures are back in fashion after a German-led round of credit easings and analysts on Friday said best bets are in calendar trades and Eurolire.Peripheral European countries such as Italy had the most to gain from the Bundesbank's hefty 30 basis point repo cut on Thursday, they said. At the same time, front month contracts might not fare as well as some later-dated futures.\"All the short ends are looking very, very positive. Short sterling is breaking up to new highs, Euromarks are breaking upwards,\" said Steve Hutt of NatWest Financial Futures.\"The one concern is they are perhaps getting a little overbought,\" said Hutt, a technical analyst. He said in this environment a good buy would be \"deferred month\" contracts.This meant selling the near-term futures contracts such as December Euromarks and December Eurolire and buying months such as June 1997 and Septmeber 1997.\"Any more optimism for potentially more easing will be early next year,\" Hutt said. \"While that hope exists it's going to be the more deferred contracts that will catch up.\"Among the main European contracts, Eurolire stood the best chance of outperforming, analysts said.December Eurolire broke out of a downtrend on Thursday, insprired by the Bundesbank's interest rate cut. They climbed to a high of 92.00 -- implying three-month lira rates of eight percent come December -- from a 91.78 low.By 1300 GMT, they had eased back to 91.91.\"We've seen a bit of a pullback in Eurolire. It looks like mild proifit taking,\" said Peter Osler, head of research at GNI in London. \"Looking at that there's still upside scope.\"Norman Beauchamp, head of derivatives at Cooperative Bank in London, was also a fan of the Italian market.\"Eurolire I think is going to be the best performer,\" he said. \"With Germany cutting rates, that should allow Italy to cut rates.\"He added, \"Although the December contract is probably discounting a 3/4 point rate cut. There's potentially 1-1/2 points and maybe two points.\"Osler said the Bundesbank's action took pressure off other European currencie and that sooner or later the Bank of France too might cut interest rates unilaterly.\"I would have thought we still have a little bit more upside on Pibor as well,\" he said.The September Pibor contract on the MATIF was last at 96.03, after surging to a 96.15 top on Thursday from a 95.75 low.The one area analysts were a little nervous about, though, was short sterling, which is not tied to German rate policy in the way the other European contracts are.\"I'd be a small seller of short sterling,\" Osler said.The December short sterling contract has jumped to new contract highs following the cut. It was last at 94.28, having risen to a 94.32 peak earlier on Friday.\"On an outright basis in sterling from here I'd be a little hesitant to start buying the front contracts,\" said Hutt.He said that three-month British money rates -- which short sterling is based on -- themselves are likely to have a premium over base rates after the next British policy easing.\"As soon as they make one more move that will be factored in as definitely the last move,\" Hutt said. So although base rates may fall by 25 basis points, three-month money rates will probably fall by a smaller amount.\"In the same way they cut the repo by 30 basis points but Euromarks ended up around 15,\" he said.But Hutt still favoured the deferred month contracts for short sterling as a calendar spread trade.--International Bonds Unit +44 171 542 6784", "label": ["M131", "M13", "MCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Indonesian authorities and the country's leading opposition figure signalled on Thursday they are trying to negotiate an end to a row that has sharply raised political tensions.Lawyers for the government and for Megawati Sukarnoputri, ousted chief of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and daughter of late founding president Sukarno, said they would discuss their differences.However, political analysts said chances for an agreement were remote.Central Jakarta District Court chief judge I Gde Ketut Suarta, who was hearing a lawsuit filed by Megawati against her removal, said an out-of-court settlement was in progress and he would give both sides one week to negotiate.Megawati, who was not present in court, declined to comment on the development, which comes after months of political unrest in Indonesia capped by riots in Jakarta last month and a subsequent government crackdown.\"I don't have any comment at the moment. I have given everything to my lawyers,\" she said.Aides said she planned to meet her legal team later on Thursday to discuss the case. They said no immediate political strategy was expected to be announced and there were no details on what shape a settlement might take.Megawati is suing the government and the military for backing a rival PDI faction which deposed her from the leadership in June. Members of the rival faction, including its leader Surjadi, were also named as defendants.\"The offer for an out-of-court settlement is the best. We will do it if the defendants share our perceptions,\" said Megawati's chief lawyer, R.O. Tambunan, at the court.However, a lawyer for the national police chief, who has been cited as a defendant, said: \"We agreed with the offer, but only on one condition -- the suit must be dropped. We are also ready to face it because we have nothing to do with the PDI.\"Muchtar Buchori, a political commentator who is close to Megawati, said she would at least demand reinstatement as the party chief in exchange for dropping the case.\"I think her reinstatement will be very difficult,\" said independent analyst Dewi Fortuna Anwar. \"Since the president has accepted Surjadi as (PDI) chairman, it will be difficult to wriggle out of that.\"Megawati has been at the centre of a political storm since her ejection from the PDI's top post. Her removal led to some of the most severe protests in the three-decades rule of President Suharto and riots broke out in Jakarta on July 27 after police cleared the PDI headquarters of her supporters.At least four people died and scores of buildings and vehicles were set on fire during the violence, the worst in the city for more than 20 years.The government has since cracked down on dissent and taken over 200 people into custody. Some have been charged with subversion, a crime punishable by death.Megawati has been questioned twice by police in connection with the riots but has not been charged.Political analysts have said the government backed the move to depose Megawati because it feared she could cut into the ruling Golkar party's votes in next year's parliamentary elections and perhaps stand against Suharto in the 1998 presidential elections.", "label": ["GCAT", "GCRIM", "GPOL"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
{"token": "Lloyd's of London was braced on Tuesday for a possible ruling in a crucial United States court case, which threatens at the last minute to upset a recovery plan for the 300-year-old insurance market.Tens of thousands of investors in Lloyd's worldwide are anxiously awaiting the outcome of the case in Virginia, where U.S. investors (Names) have applied for an injunction to stop the recovery plan in its tracks.Under its rescue proposals, Lloyd's is to reinsure billions of pounds in liabilities, including pollution and asbestosis- related claims in the U.S., into a new company called Equitas.Names have only eight days left in which to accept or reject this plan, on which the future of the market hangs.Since improving the terms of the proposals, which include a 3.2 billion pounds ($4.95 billion) offer to Names designed to offset the cost of Equitas, support among British Names for the plan has grown.A last ditch attempt at securing more favourable treatment by a British-based action group floundered last week, when the High Court threw out a case for judicial review of the plan.But in the U.S., Lloyd's has for several years faced a giant raft of litigation. This latest challenge by 100 American Names contends that Lloyd's has breached U.S. disclosure laws.The insurance market's chief executive Ron Sandler is fighting the action personally. He was cross-examined on Monday.Judge Robert Payne in that sitting criticised the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to determine whether Lloyd's should be subject to U.S. securities laws.The legal challenge was complicated on Friday by the SEC's neutral position on this issue. Payne said the SEC would have a second opportunity to respond to his request for a ruling.Early on Tuesday morning, however, Lloyd's received a boost from a separate court case in New York, which dismissed action brought against the market by four Names. They had claimed that Lloyd's knew long ago the extent of liabilities faced by Names.\"We are pleased by this decision. Names entered into their commitments under UK law and we are pleased that U.S. courts continue to recognise this,\" said Lloyd's U.S. boss Peter Lane.In Britain, meanwhile, a former Name heading an action group of loss-making investors, has hit out at Lloyd's for \"breaking promises\" he says were made to the hardest-hit Names.The outspoken chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations' Working Party and the deputy leader of the Lloyd's Defence Shield, Christopher Stockwell, ended weeks of silence with the charge Lloyd's has \"reneged\" on income and housing pledges.Stockwell said the scheme was entirely dependent on the availability of future funds. This meant Lloyd's could end the scheme any time, which amounted to no formal commitment.He also claimed fewer than 20 percent of Names have so far accepted the recovery plan. Lloyd's rejected both statements.The market last week published guidelines for helping those Names who were worst off after accepting its recovery plan.($1=.6471 Pound)", "label": ["C12", "CCAT", "GCAT", "GCRIM"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Ltd., were a danger to consumers because they \"tipped up high on two wheels\" in road tests.The magazine said consumers should stop buying the models, called for an immediate recall of the approximately 35,000 cars that have been sold and said repairs or replacement models should be offered by the manufacturer.\"We don't think a vehicle that has these characteristics should do what it did when subjected to this not inconceivable situation,\" said Bob Knoll, director of testing for Consumer Reports' auto division, in a telephone interviewA spokesman for Isuzu defended the vehicles.\"It's very important for both consumers in general and Isuzu Trooper owners to understand very clearly that the Isuzu Trooper meets all federal safety standards and regulations,\" Isuzu spokesman Daniel McCue told Reuters.But Smith Barney analyst David Garrity said the report by the influential magazine could prove damaging.\"If Consumer Reports comes out and says, 'Don't buy this product,' the sales will go down,\" Garrity said. \"You saw what happened to the Suzuki Samurai in the '80s.\"The tiny Suzuki Samurai, introduced in the mid-1980s, was also the target of a Consumer Reports article alleging that the sport/utility vehicle was prone to rollovers. The campaign eventually led to the vehicle being pulled off the market.Garrity said the report was a blow to Honda's Acura brand, which it has worked hard to cultivate. \"If I were Honda, I'd demand (of Isuzu) that the problem be fixed, and I'd be more focused on developing my own product,\" he said.Consumer Reports also asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate the Trooper and SLX and called for more stringent government oversight of vehicles with narrow wheelbases.Government regulations currently call for all vehicles with a wheel base of 110 inches or less to carry a warning sticker stating that \"sharp turns or abrupt manoeuvres\" may cause the vehicle to roll over or crash.Both the Trooper and the SLX have wheelbases of 108.7 inches.Both companies said they were reviewing Consumer Report's test data and would look further into the matter.Neither McCue nor Acura spokesman Mike Spencer knew of any reports from customers of their vehicles tipping or rolling over, and neither knew of any ongoing NHTSA investigation.\"We have not had an opportunity to thoroughly review the testing methodology used. Nevertheless, Acura believes the SLX is a safe and reliable vehicle when driven in a responsible manner,\" Spencer told Reuters.According to Spencer, only about 1,857 SLXs have been sold since the vehicle was introduced in November, 1995.", "label": ["C13", "C21", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Retailers provided the main impetus.Markets were nervously awaiting the interest rate decisions from a Federal Reserve open market committee meeting later on Tuesday, and the Bundesbank's Council meeting on Thursday.Given these worries, positive German money supply data failed to inspire the German stock market, which traded mixed after the Bundesbank announced slower growth of key M3 money supply figures and virtually guaranteed a cut in its key money market rate.French stocks opened higher and breezed up 21 points, quickly pushing the index through the 2,000 barrier for the first time since August 8, on strengthened hopes of a new round of rate cuts.Wall Street, also stilled by the FOMC meeting and general summer torpor, had its slowest full day of trade this year on Monday, which may have influenced Frankfurt's less than euphoric response to the money supply data.Analysts said the British money supply figures would give further ammunition to Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke if he wants to trim the 5.75 percent base interest rate again in coming months.\"It is a good figure...most people hadn't expected the figure to come back into the monitoring range, which is about the first time for six or seven months,\" said economist Keith Wade of Schroders.In Germany, growth in M3, the German central bank's main policy guide, slowed to an annualised 8.6 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June.\"It is now very clear that we have a very good chance to reach the Bundesbank target zone (of four to seven percent growth for 1996). I think there is a very good chance that we will see a cut in the repo rate,\" said Uwe Angenendt, economist at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt.Assuming no change in U.S. interest rates, analysts expect germany's key money market, or repo, to be pared, although opinions vary as to the size of a possible cut.The sleepy dollar was confined to narrow ranges throughout an extremely quiet European morning session, barely twitching an eyelid in reaction to a softer than generally expected German M3 number.Volume was thin with few dealers willing to get involved.\"OK, so the Fed probably won't move and the Bundesbank probably will, particularly after that good M3 number. But in this market you will get killed if you're wrong and have a big position,\" said one trader. \"I'm not taking the risk.\"CURRENCIES  AT 1130 GMTDollar/mark was trading at 1.4902 and dollar/yen at 107.90 versus Monday's late 1.4875 and 107.90.

{"token": "South Korea's Samsung Aerospace Industries returned to The Hague on Tuesday to discuss buying bankrupt planemaker Fokker, the Dutch Economics Ministry said Wednesday.Samsung carried out takeover talks on two earlier occasions, one prior to the Dutch planemaker's bankruptcy on March 15 and one immediately after it. A large delegation showed up in The Hague on Tuesday to build on the groundwork of previous talks.\"The weight of the delegation is hard to assess, but it's safe to assume they didn't send just anyone,\" a spokesman said.Samsung wanted the Dutch state to play a role in the rebirth of Fokker, he added.\"Relaunch talks are carried out by the court-appointed receivers. Only if interested parties want something from the Dutch state, they come and talk with us,\" the spokesman said.He declined to comment on the negotiations, attended also by the Fokker receivers, but said Samsung was not the only company interested in acquiring Fokker's aircraft manufacturing unit.\"The minister said in July that there are still several candidates...it's hard to tell which of the negotiations is in the most advanced stage,\" he said.The spokesman for the receivers, Ben Knueppe, declined to comment on what he called \"interim reports\".\"There are talks with many possibly interested parties...The world is bigger than Samsung,\" he said.In July Russian's Aviatsionnaya Korporatsiya Yakovlev said it planned to take over Fokker. Other possible buyers included three Dutch businessmen who each tried to group investors.The Fokker receivers are pressing hard to find a buyer for the bankrupt planemaker as its suppliers need to know whether they should dismantle their production lines for Fokker parts.Fokker will make planes at least until April 1997 as part of a post-bankruptcy plan, but the supplies for these planes will be delivered in the next few months.\"If the suppliers do not get a green light, they will take down their production lines in September or October. A relaunch will then be very difficult,\" a source close to Fokker said.In order to take the pressure off the talks, the receivers are studying ways to keep the plant open beyond April 1997.In June Fokker accepted orders for seven aircraft, six new Fokker 70s for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and one Fokker 50 for Formosa Airlines. These orders, alongside eight orders from before the bankruptcy, will keep Fokker airborne until April.Asked why Fokker's life after death had been extended, one of the receivers said it was the best way of preserving assets.The slimmed-down plant employs several hundred staff, markedly fewer than the thousands prior to the collapse.The exodus of engineers, some of whom went to U.S. planemaker Boeing, was said to be a source of concern for Samsung as the South Korean firm is only interested in buying Fokker if it is able to complete development of the Fokker 130.Fokker's profitable maintenance and services units have meanwhile been sold to Dutch technical engineering group Stork under the condition that it is prepared to sell it back to a possible buyer of the aircraft manufacturing base.-- Lucas van Grinsven, Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000", "label": ["C16", "C181", "C18", "C33", "CCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

If you have less than 12 hours to recover before the next match, it's not enough. That's what basically happened to me. I started really well, got tired and could never get out of it.\"I understand television has its needs and they want to have certain players on live,\" she said. \"It happens and as a top player you have to able to deal with everything. That's what I am and I have no complaints about it.\"\"Arantxa is a great athlete. She can run down so many balls and that makes it really difficult. Against other players a point would be over. But she still can get to the point and give you the high ball back. You have to start all over again. So it's mentally difficult to play her becaue she can last a long time and she's such a good runner.\"The deciding third set was leveled until Sanchez Vicario slammed an overhead winner for a the break and a 4-3 lead.

Date held and broke for 6-5 before holding at love for the victory.\"When Conchita came back to 4-4, I was a little uptight,\" said Date, ranked No. 9 in the world. But I felt I was in good form and could keep myself from going to pieces.\"\"I had my chances in the second set, but I played badly at 5-4,\" said Martinez, who fell to 2-6 lifetime against Date. \"When I lost my serve, that was it.\"", "label": ["GCAT", "GSPO"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}

Activity on nearby months centred on $2,000-a-tonne September call buying as market makers covered their exposure ahead of the September declaration on Wednesday.\"I would guess this is mostly cover against short Asian option positions in the market,\" said a trader.Several options traders said they did not expect to see much underlying price volatility at declaration, despite market talk of an options-related price spike next Wednesday. \"The big open interest on LME options is at $2,000. People are long of these traded options against being short of the Asians,\" said one dealer.\"If you're sensible you would lock in your $2,000 cover today. There's not too much going on after that,\" another added.Forward call buying was for $2,100 and $2,200 strikes during the first half of 1997 and into the third quarter.Volatilities firmed across the board this week having fallen sharply since the highs in June.September was quoted at 22.5 percent volatility early on Friday from 20.5 a week ago. November traded up to 23.5 percent on Thursday from 22.5 percent last Friday.Average 1997 was quoted at 20/22 percent volatility.Several dealers said huge short option positions on the over-the-counter (OTC) market continued to overhang the copper futures market, helping to keep it in a very narrow range.Big players, including banks, are said to be keeping the market in a tight range in order to protect their options exposure.\"There has been bank selling at the top of the range and bank buying at the bottom.

September was indicated around 12.5 percent volatility early on Friday against 13 percent a week ago.Nickel, zinc, lead and tin option volatilities all eased on nearby months this week in slow conditions.Both zinc and lead volatilities could go even lower soon.\"Everyone is long of zinc options and the market is just not moving.

{"token": "The European Commission and Germany will seek on Friday to defuse a heated row over public aid for Volkswagen AG which has spurred anti-European Union sentiment in the bloc's largest member state.German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, who just returned to work after a 10-week bout of malaria, is due in Brussels to meet European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert.Van Miert has warned that the move of the ex-communist eastern German state of Saxony to pay 91 million marks ($61.3 million) in unauthorised support to VW could touch off an EU \"subsidy war\" if left unchallenged.He threatened in a recent German magazine interview that Brussels could raise the stakes by blocking other aid to Europe's largest carmaker or excluding it from public tenders.\"The Commission prepares all the actions which are necessary in order to get back to legality and that will be the main objective of the meeting tomorrow,\" Commission spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told reporters on Thursday.\"You know the position we've taken on the WV case, that's absolutely clear,\" he said.Van der Pas noted that Bonn accepts Saxony's arguments that the payouts are justified but that it believes the state went too far by defying the order from Brussels.The dispute erupted last month when Saxony state premier Kurt Biedenkopf, a Christian Democrat (CDU) ally of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, overrode Commission objections to the size of a proposed aid package for VW and paid out extra funds.He warned that the state stood to lose thousands of jobs in the towns of Mosel and Chemnitz if it didn't pay.VW, which this month reported a 45 percent jump in six-month group income, had suspended plans to develop plants in the two towns after the EU executive in June rejected 240.7 million marks of the total promised aid package of 780 million marks.In deciding to trim the amount of aid, the Commission took the view that VW's production at the plants would increase capacity in an industry already suffering from overcapacity.Saxony has filed a lawsuit against the Commission to block the ruling reducing the amount of aid while Van Miert has threatened to go to the European Court of Justice if the carmaker spends the extra money.\"I think Saxony has some good arguments, VW has some good arguments and the Commission as well,\" one car industry insider said.According to Brussels, Saxony paid out 142 million marks to VW after the Commission's June decision. Of this amount, it says 91 million was unauthorised.In total, Volkswagen has received at least 522 million marks from Saxony, which struggles with a jobless rate of more than 15 percent despite rapid economic growth.One EU source said he did not believe that the Commission, which vets state aid to see whether it may harm competition, was now taking a stricter line on aid in ex-communist east Germany.\"What one can say is that the Commission is now examining all state aid cases in east Germany like any other state aid case in the Community,\" he said.($ = 1.484 German Marks)", "label": ["C17", "C34", "CCAT", "G157", "G15", "GCAT"], "doc_topic": [], "doc_keyword": []}
